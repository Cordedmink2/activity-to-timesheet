"""The zone a day is read in, and the clock arithmetic that follows from it.

Both halves of this skill need this and neither owns it. The day-reading scripts need it to
bound a day, to parse a `--window` and to render an instant a person will read; the provider
scripts need it to tell whether an entry runs through a clock change that would bill it
short. It lived in `aw_client.py` until #36, which meant `harvest_post.py` and
`harvest_patch.py` imported the activity-source client to get at it — the one import edge
that ran the wrong way, and one an adapter behind a boundary cannot have. Nothing about the
functions changed in the move; only where they live.

So this module knows about neither side: it reads the configured zone through
`skill_config`, like everything else here, and imports nothing else of this skill's.
`tests/test_module_boundaries.py` holds that.

**A zone, not an offset.** A day does not necessarily have one offset — on the two dates a
year the clocks change it has two — so every conversion below takes the zone itself and
resolves each instant at the offset in force for *it*. `resolve_zone()` says what a single
figure read once cost.

No third-party deps — stdlib `zoneinfo`, like the sibling modules.

    """The timezone this day's local clock is read in.

    `flag` is whatever `--utc-offset` supplied, or None; it wins, so a day spent in
    another zone can still be reconstructed without reconfiguring anything. It resolves to
    a zone that is that offset all year, which is what passing a number has always meant.
    Otherwise the configured `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` is loaded.

    `offers_offset_flag=False` says the calling script has no such per-run override —
    which the provider scripts have not, carrying no flags but their fields and the
    confirmation gate. The messages below then stop naming `--utc-offset`, rather than
    sending a user who is already stuck to try one more thing that would come back as a
    usage error.

    A boolean and not the flag's own spelling, which is what it was first written as: a
    bare `"--utc-offset"` default here is indistinguishable from a flag *this* module
    parses, and `tests/test_references.py` said so — it reads the flags out of each
    script's syntax tree and wanted this one added to the inventory entry of the module
    this used to live in, where it would tell every run that a module with no command line
    takes an argument. There is one spelling of the flag either way, so nothing is lost by
    not passing it.

    A zone rather than a number, because a day does not necessarily have *one* offset.
    This used to answer with a single figure read at local noon, and on the day the clocks
    change that is wrong at both ends of the day at once: the fetch window opens an hour
    late or early, and every event on the far side of the transition renders an hour out.
    Neither failure raises anything — the day simply reads short and starts in the wrong
    place. Handing the zone itself to the arithmetic below lets each instant be converted
    at the offset in force for *it*.

    There is deliberately no fallback. This used to be `default=12.0` in both day-reading
    scripts' argument parsers, so every user who was not in New Zealand got a day boundary
    up to twelve hours out — and, again, nothing failed. No offset is safe to guess, so an

    - no transition at all, which is every date but two a year;
    - a spring-forward. The clock skips rather than repeating, so an entry across it is
      over-billed rather than short, and its two pieces would be separated by a gap where

      the offset shift and not from the order of the two readings, which gets
      `America/Santiago` exactly backwards;
    - a repeated span that crosses midnight, as it does in `America/Santiago`, where the
      clocks go back at 00:00 to 23:00. Containment would then need an end past 1440, and
      a clock reading caps at 23:59 — so a span that opens at 23:00 and closes at 00:00

    Answered in minutes since midnight, not as the two `time`s the transition carries,

    conversion would be the second place the midnight-crossing case has to be got right.
    `harvest_write.py`'s `refusal_for_a_straddled_change()` is the one that decides what to

    can skip reading the entry it is about to patch, which is a request over the wire.

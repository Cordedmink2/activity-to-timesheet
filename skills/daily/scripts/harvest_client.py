"""Shared Harvest API helper for the billables `daily` skill.

  load_creds() -> (account_id, api_key)
  request(method, path, body=None, query=None) -> dict (parsed JSON) or raises RuntimeError

Credentials are the one setting this module owns, because the pair of keys and the
message a first-run user gets are Harvest's business. *Where* a value comes from is not:
that is `skill_config`, which holds the precedence rule for every setting in the skill.
This module used to hold both, which meant the `.env`/OS-env walk existed twice — once in
`config()` and once, subtly its own way, in `load_creds()`.

If either HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID or HARVEST_API_KEY fails to resolve, exits with a message
pointing at `.env.example`, through the shared error contract in `skill_config.fail_missing()`.

No third-party deps — uses stdlib `urllib` like the sibling `aw_*.py` helpers.

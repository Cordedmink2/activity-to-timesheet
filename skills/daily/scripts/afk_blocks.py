"""Deterministic AFK-watcher analyzer for the billables `daily` skill.

The skill's Step 3 needs a few facts that are easy to get *wrong* by eyeballing
raw ActivityWatch JSON: where the day genuinely ends, where the real breaks are,
and how "active" a candidate block actually is. The classic failure is trusting
the *window* watcher — a terminal / IDE / LockApp window can sit in the
foreground for ages after the user has walked away, so its event duration looks
like work but isn't. The AFK watcher is the authoritative activity signal; this
script reduces it to clean numbers so the model can classify instead of doing
timestamp arithmetic in its head.

What it computes (all times rendered in the user's local zone):
  - work start / work end  -> first and LAST `not-afk` moment of the day. Work
    end is the true end-of-day; never bill past it.
  - breaks                 -> `afk` spans >= the break threshold (default 1050s).
  - active spans           -> contiguous `not-afk` runs, short afk folded in.
  - total active minutes.
  - window-watcher tail     -> end of the last window event, flagged when it runs
    past work end (that gap is the left-in-focus trap, not real work).
  - active_ratio for an arbitrary --window HH:MM-HH:MM (the Step 3 validation).

No third-party deps — stdlib urllib, via the shared aw_client.py.

Usage:
  python scripts/afk_blocks.py 2026-05-28
  python scripts/afk_blocks.py 2026-05-28 --window 18:45-20:00
  python scripts/afk_blocks.py 2026-05-28 --json
  python scripts/afk_blocks.py 2026-05-28 --utc-offset 13   # this run only

The day's boundaries come from the configured TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE — or, when none
is configured, from this machine's own zone, which the output then labels as
derived — converted at each instant rather than once for the day, so the day the
clocks change is read at its true length and needs nothing from the user.
--utc-offset overrides both for one run. There is no assumed zone and no fixed
fallback: see timezone.resolve_zone_with_source for why.

The judgement constants below (--solid, --blip-gap, --min-uncovered, the two
bands) are defaults, not policy. They are a person's working style, so they
belong in the user's workspace `context.md` § Preferences, from where the model
passes them here.

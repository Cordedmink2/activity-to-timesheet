"""Writing to the provider: the confirmation gate, the preview, the guards in front of both,
and the `OK` / `ERR` contract.

Not a script. `harvest_post.py` and `harvest_patch.py` each *declare* the write they
would make — `create(body)` or `update(entry_id, body)` — and hand it to `perform()`, and
everything a write has in common happens here, once:

  take_gate(argv)        -> (argv without the gate, whether it was there)
  ordered_minutes(a, b)  -> both clock times as minutes, or `ERR` and exit 1
  refusal_for_a_straddled_change(spent, start_min, end_min, zone)
                         -> why this entry cannot be billed as one, or None
  perform(write, confirmed)
      unconfirmed: print `WOULD POST <body>` / `WOULD PATCH <id> <body>`, then a line
                   naming the flag, and exit 0 — nothing was *written*. A caller's own
                   guards may have read from the provider first; `harvest_patch.py` does
      confirmed:   send it; print `OK <id>` and exit 0, or `ERR <status> <body>` to
                   stderr and exit 1

**`--confirm` is the confirmation gate.** It is not a field and not a promise in prose:
without it nothing is written. `SKILL.md` Step 8 is where the user's yes is obtained;
`docs/skills/daily/decision-log.md` (in the repository, not in an installed copy) § "The
confirmation gate is in the invocation, not only the prose" is why the gate is here as well as there — the frontmatter field that stops a model starting the
skill unprompted is honoured by some harnesses and dropped by others.

The gate is taken off the argument list before anything reads it positionally, so it may be
typed anywhere and no field flag left without its value can swallow it. `--notes --confirm`
once set the notes to the literal string `--confirm`, previewed that as though it were
meant, and — because the preview's own last line says to re-run with the flag — wrote it to
a client-facing timesheet on the next attempt.

The preview is the request body itself, rendered from the same `Write` the confirmed run
sends, so what the user approved and what went on the wire cannot come apart. A preview
that described the entry in its own words would be a second description free to drift
from the first, with the user approving the paraphrase.

The gate is a property of writing, not of reaching the provider, so a script that only
reads has no business here and calls `harvest_client.request()` for itself. The two guards
are here on the same test: each refuses a body *either* writer could assemble, and each is
about what Harvest does with the two clock times it stores rather than about what the
clocks did — that half is `timezone.py`'s, and both guards read it from there.

This existed twice — once per write script, with every fix landing twice or not at all —
until #22. It is what ADR-0006 says the provider's command contract should own, and where
that contract's design (#33) will find it.

    Harvest stores two clock times and bills their difference. On the day the clocks go
    back, an entry worked straight through the change is short by exactly the span that
    happened twice: `01:30`-`04:15` in `Pacific/Auckland` on 2026-04-05 bills 2.75 hrs for
    3.75 hrs of work. Nothing raises — the entry is well-formed, and it reads correctly in
    every listing afterwards, so there is no later moment at which anyone finds out.

    Here rather than in either write script because both reach it: a create refuses the
    entry it was handed, a patch refuses the entry its change would *result* in, and the
    message is the same one. It was `harvest_post.py`'s until #36, which is why
    `harvest_patch.py` imported a script to print it. What the zone did on the date is
    `timezone.py`'s (`repeated_span()`); what Harvest does with two clock times is this
    module's, and this message is the second half — which is also why it stays on the
    provider's side of the boundary rather than travelling with the arithmetic.

    That span is an hour in most zones and is never assumed to be: `Australia/Lord_Howe`
    moves thirty minutes and `Antarctica/Troll` two hours, and every figure in the message
    below is measured off the zone's own two readings.

    **It refuses only the entry that is unambiguously wrong**, which is the one whose clock
    interval contains the repeated span with both ends strictly outside it. The tempting
    rule — "the clock interval and the elapsed time disagree" — refuses the two
    replacements this message recommends, because `01:30`-`03:00` also spans 1.5 clock
    hours and 2.5 real ones if its end is read as the unambiguous `03:00` an hour after the
    change. That reading is why the ends have to be strict: an entry *ending* at
    `03:00` or *starting* at `02:00` is one of the two recommendations under one reading
    and an hour short under the other, and this cannot refuse its own advice. Inside the
    span the script likewise cannot know which pass a bare `02:30` means, and both readings
    bill correctly for their own pass. `references/output-format.md` keeps the hand-split
    guidance for everything left over.

    It refuses rather than splitting. Two entries out of one approval would put a body on
    the wire the user never previewed, which is the property the confirmation gate exists
    to hold.

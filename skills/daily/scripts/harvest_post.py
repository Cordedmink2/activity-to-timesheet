"""Create a Harvest time entry. Compact output for low token cost.

Usage:
  python harvest_post.py PROJECT_ID TASK_ID YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM HH:MM 'notes' [--confirm]

**`--confirm` is the confirmation gate.** Without it nothing is written: the
script prints the exact body it would have sent and exits 0, so a forgotten flag
yields a preview rather than an error. The gate, the preview and the `OK` / `ERR`
contract are `harvest_write.py`'s, shared with `harvest_patch.py`; this script
declares the body and the guards in front of it. SKILL.md Step 8 is where the
user's yes is obtained; docs/skills/daily/decision-log.md (in the repository, not in an
installed copy) § "The confirmation gate" is why the gate is in the invocation as well as there.

Times accept either 24h ("08:15") or 12h ("8:15am") — Harvest accepts both.
Always sends started_time + ended_time so accounts in start/end-time mode get
a fixed-duration entry (not a running timer). See SKILL.md Step 9 for context.

Harvest derives the duration from those two clock times, which is wrong by an
hour for an entry worked straight through the autumn change — so this needs
`TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` to know when that is, and refuses such an entry rather
than billing it short. See `harvest_write.refusal_for_a_straddled_change()`,
which `harvest_patch.py` refuses with too.

Use SINGLE quotes around notes in bash/PowerShell to avoid $variable
interpolation mangling money references like "$5k" or token-shaped substrings.

Success: prints `OK <entry_id>` and exits 0.
Preview: prints `WOULD POST <body>` and exits 0 — no entry exists.
Failure: prints `ERR <status> <body[:200]>` to stderr and exits 1.

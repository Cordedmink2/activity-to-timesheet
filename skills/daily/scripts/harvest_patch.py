"""Update an existing Harvest time entry. PATCH semantics — only passed fields change.

WARNING: --hours is a footgun on start/end-time accounts.
If the account stores entries as started_time + ended_time (most accounts,
including the typical consultancy setup), patching with just --hours leaves the
entry inconsistent or converts it to a running timer. Always prefer
--start HH:MM --end HH:MM to change duration. --hours is retained for
duration-mode accounts only.

Same shape of trap with --start or --end on their own: if you pass --start
without --end (or vice versa), Harvest recomputes hours from the unchanged
side, which is rarely what you meant. To shift a block, pass BOTH --start
and --end. Only pass one alone if you genuinely want Harvest to grow/shrink
the entry by holding the other side fixed.

Usage:
  python harvest_patch.py ENTRY_ID [--start HH:MM] [--end HH:MM]
                                   [--notes '...'] [--hours N]
                                   [--project-id N] [--task-id N]
                                   [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--confirm]

At least one field flag must be provided.

**`--confirm` is the confirmation gate**, and is not a field: without it nothing
is written, and the script prints the entry id and the exact body it would have
sent, then exits 0. It may be typed before or after the entry id, as in
`harvest_post.py` — the gate, the preview and the `OK` / `ERR` contract are one
implementation in `harvest_write.py`, shared by both. The gate matters more here
than on a create: a patch overwrites a line that has already been reviewed and
may already have been invoiced, and Harvest has no undo. See `harvest_write.py`
for why the gate lives in the invocation rather than only in SKILL.md's prose.

Harvest recomputes an entry's duration from its two clock times on a patch exactly as it
does on a create, so a patch can arrive at the entry a create refuses — one worked
straight through the autumn change, billed short by the span that happened twice. This
needs `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` to know when that is, and it reads the entry to know what the
patch would leave behind: see `refuse_a_result_that_straddles_the_change()` below. That
read happens on the preview too — what must not be applied must not be offered — so
previewing a change to a time or a date now needs the provider to answer.

Use SINGLE quotes around --notes values to avoid shell $variable interpolation
mangling money references and other dollar-prefixed substrings.

Success: prints `OK <entry_id>` and exits 0.
Preview: prints `WOULD PATCH <entry_id> <body>` and exits 0 — nothing changed.
Failure: prints `ERR <status> <body[:200]>` to stderr and exits 1.

    `harvest_write.refusal_for_a_straddled_change()` says why such an entry cannot be
    billed as one, and prints the same message here as it does on a create: Harvest bills
    the difference between the two clock times, so an entry worked through the change is
    short by the span that happened twice, and nothing raises. One message with one owner —
    `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (in the repository, not in an installed copy) § "Rules with more
    than one copy" registers it as that function's, and its arithmetic has already been wrong in prose once.

    Three things make this more than that one call, and each is a decision:

    - **A patch carries only what it changes**, so `--start` alone, `--end` alone and
      `--date` alone are each a whole straddling entry once laid over the one already
      there. The guard is on the result, and reading the rest of it costs a GET. Not paid
      for where nothing in the body could move a clock, where a `--date` names a day with
      no repeated span, or where the body already says all three.
    - **`--hours` states a duration the clock cannot**, which is the only way to correct
      such an entry on a duration-mode account. It is not refused, and it ends the
      question before the read — but only where it is the whole answer. Passed *with*
      times it settles nothing: Harvest recomputes hours from `started_time` /
      `ended_time` whenever they are there, so a body carrying both would land the
      straddle with a duration in it that changed nothing. See the module docstring for
      what `--hours` alone does to a start/end-time account, which is the usual one.
    - **The result may hold no clock interval at all.** A duration-mode entry comes back
      with `started_time` null, and the guard refuses only what it can read: inventing an
      interval would block the accounts `--hours` exists for.

    Like every guard here it runs before the gate is consulted. The preview is what the
    user says yes to, and its own last line says to re-run with the flag, so a change that
    must not be applied must not be offered either.

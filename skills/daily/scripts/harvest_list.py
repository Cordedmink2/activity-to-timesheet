"""List Harvest time entries for a date range. One compact line per entry.

Usage:
  python harvest_list.py YYYY-MM-DD [YYYY-MM-DD] [--by-day]

If only one date is given, it's used as both `from` and `to`.

Output (sorted by date, then start time, 24h):
  <id>  <date>  <HH:MM>-<HH:MM>  <h>h  <project_code>  <task[:25]>  <notes[:60]>

`--by-day` collapses that to one row per *date* instead — the month sweep the
`reconcile` skill runs:
  <date>  <Day>  <total>h  <n> entries  <project codes>

Every date in the range gets a row, including the ones holding nothing. A day
with no entries is absent from the per-entry listing, and absent is precisely
what an unbilled day looks like — so reading gaps off that listing means
reasoning about what was never printed. The totals are arithmetic, and
arithmetic done by eye over a hundred rows is wrong quietly.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Sets up the workday screenshot grabber: installs the Pillow + mss dependencies and
  registers ONE Windows scheduled task that fires screenshot_capture.py every
  ~2.5 minutes across the workday.

.DESCRIPTION
  This is the only screenshot task the billables daily skill needs. It runs as
  the current (non-admin) user while you're logged in, capturing into
  ~/Pictures/WorkScreenshots/<date>/. The capture script creates the dated
  folders itself, so there's no separate folder-structure step.

  Re-running is safe: -Force replaces any existing task of the same name.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1
  # default: WorkScreenshots, weekdays 08:30-20:00, every 150s

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1 -StartTime 09:00 -EndTime 18:00 -IntervalSeconds 300

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1 -DryRun
  # prints the task it would register and exits; installs nothing, registers nothing

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1 -PythonExe C:\Python313\python.exe
  # pin the interpreter when PATH resolution picks the wrong one (Store stub, broken install)

This module carries the reasoning for the precedence below; the restatements of it are
registered in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` § "Rules with more than one copy" (in the repository,
not in an installed copy — as is the decision log cited below), so a change here has a list
of the other copies to change with it.

Precedence, highest first:

  1. **A per-command flag**, where the script offers one — overrides a single run.
  2. **The skill `.env` file** at the skill root, next to `SKILL.md`. Simple `KEY=VALUE`
     lines; blank lines and `#` comments allowed, surrounding quotes stripped.
  3. **The process environment**, which is where a harness injects values — for the
     commands it injects them into. Claude Code publishes them as a POSIX shell
     fragment applied to its **Bash** tool alone, so a script the model runs through
     PowerShell finds this layer empty on a machine configured perfectly well. That is
     not a fourth source to add; it is one shell missing the third, and
     `note_for_an_unreached_shell()` is what says so when a required setting is absent.
  4. **The script's own default**, when it documents one.

`.env` beating the process environment is the order as it has always behaved, kept
deliberately rather than reconsidered here — a prefactor is the wrong place to change
which of a user's two configured values wins.

A value that is blank or whitespace-only counts as *unset* at every layer, so it falls
through to the next one — see `has_value()`. `DATAVERSE_URL=` left behind in a copied
`.env.example` means "I don't use this", and a scheduler that passes an empty string for
an omitted argument must not thereby discard the configured value. This is a deliberate
widening: the `.env` layer already discarded blanks, because `_parse_env_file` strips,
while a whitespace-only *environment variable* used to be handed to the caller verbatim.
`docs/skills/daily/decision-log.md` § "Settled decisions" records why that inconsistency was not preserved.

Nothing here is provider-specific: the keys belong to their callers, and the credentials
contract in particular stays in `harvest_client.load_creds()`. This module owns only the
question of *where a value comes from*.

No third-party deps — stdlib only, so a script that imports it stays importable on a
machine that has nothing but Python.

    did not reach this process at all. An empty string when it did, or could not have.

    A plugin install's values are published by a SessionStart hook writing a POSIX shell
    fragment, and Claude Code applies that to its **Bash** tool alone — the PowerShell tool
    is given no equivalent and loads no profile. So a script the model happens to run
    through PowerShell reports the timezone or the credentials missing on a machine that
    is configured perfectly well, and the two lines above this note send the user off to
    start a new session or install Git Bash. Neither is the fix, and following either
    costs them the run. `docs/skills/daily/decision-log.md` § "Two ways the configuration does not arrive"
    carries the evidence and the mechanisms rejected before settling on saying so.

    **What is checked is the fact itself, not a proxy for it.** The marker rides in the
    same fragment as the values, so a process holding one holds the other; there is no
    arrangement of shells, launchers or inherited environments that delivers the values
    without it. That is what the first version got wrong — see `PUBLISHED_MARK` above.

    It stays silent unless this is a **plugin** install, because that is the only shape
    with a publishing step to have missed. An exported or hand-installed copy reads its
    values from `.env`, and telling that user to change shell would name a mechanism that
    is not in play and a fix that does nothing.

    Three causes remain and nothing here can separate them — the fragment is equally
    absent when the hook never started, and when this plugin is not enabled in the
    directory the session began in — so all three are named, which costs the user two
    lines and saves them a reinstall. The enablement one is the least guessable of the
    three: a plugin installed at **local** scope is bound to the one directory it was
    installed from (`installed_plugins.json` records it as a `projectPath`), so a sibling
    checkout gets no hook, no fragment and no values in *either* shell — while the two
    fixes the note used to offer, re-run in Bash and install Git Bash, are both already
    satisfied. `claude plugin list` is the only thing that tells them apart, so the note
    names the check and not a fix.

    A shell can only be the cause where there are two of them, so that cause is dropped
    on a platform with no PowerShell tool; the other two are not platform-specific and
    are named everywhere.

    `platform` and `environ` are parameters so the cells are driven by argument; the
    install shape is read from `SKILL_ROOT`, which the tests relocate anyway.

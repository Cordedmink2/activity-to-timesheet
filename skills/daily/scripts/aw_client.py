"""Shared ActivityWatch REST helpers for the billables `daily` skill.

`afk_blocks.py` reads the day skeleton, `activity_timeline.py` reads its content, and
`calendar_day.py` reads the window events again to decide whether a calendar event was
attended. All three talk to the same local AW server the same way: discover a
hostname-suffixed bucket, pull a day of events, collapse the heartbeats. The first two used
to carry their own copy of that code, so a fix to one left the other wrong; `window_day()`
below is the fetch-and-refuse the two window readers share, and `NOISE_FLOOR` / `GAP_FOLD`
are the one copy of what they both treat as noise.

It also owns the one fact about *where* a day is read — the server's address — because
every reader needs it and none should answer it its own way. It resolves through
`skill_config`, so it arrives from wherever the user configured it and nothing here knows
about the harness.

*When* a day is read is `timezone.py`'s, and was this module's until #36: the provider
scripts need the same arithmetic and were importing this client to get at it. Everything
about a zone or a clock reading is there — `resolve_zone()`, `utc_bounds()`,
`local_clock()`, `parse_range()` — and the two day-reading scripts import it directly.

No third-party deps - stdlib urllib, like the sibling harvest_*.py helpers.

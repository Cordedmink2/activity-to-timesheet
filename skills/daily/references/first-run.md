# Setup — first run per user / per machine

Read this only when a prerequisite check fails (no workspace, missing `.context.md`, unconfigured credentials or timezone, no screenshot task, unknown AW buckets). Routine runs never need this file.

**A first install is not this file.** The `setup` skill beside this one walks a first-time install — the activity source, the browser extension, the profile tags, the category rules (which it writes for the user rather than asking them to), the screenshot task — and verifies each one before moving on. This file is the mid-run diagnostic: one prerequisite came back wrong on a machine that was already working.

The skill is **shareable across users**. Each user maintains their own `Timesheets/.context.md` describing *their* clients, colleagues, billing conventions, and preferences. The skill stays generic; `.context.md` carries the personal facts.

## Screenshot grabber (one-time, per machine)

The skill bundles its own capture pipeline. From the skill's `scripts/` folder:

```powershell
pwsh -File setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1
```

This installs Pillow + mss if needed and registers a single scheduled task (`WorkScreenshots`) that runs *this* `scripts/screenshot_capture.py` in place every ~2.5 min on weekdays, 08:30–20:00, saving to `~/Pictures/WorkScreenshots/<date>/`. Because it points at the script in the skill folder, future skill updates take effect with no re-copying. The capture script creates the dated folders itself. Re-running the setup safely replaces the task (`-Force`); pass `-StartTime`/`-EndTime`/`-IntervalSeconds` to adjust the window. Add `-DryRun` to print the task it would register — command line, schedule and capture directory — without installing packages or registering anything. To capture somewhere other than `~/Pictures/WorkScreenshots`, set `TIMESHEET_SCREENSHOTS_DIR` (`/plugin configure billables`, or `.env` on an exported install) **and** pass the same path as `-ScreenshotsDir`, so the reader and the scheduled task agree. The scheduled task runs outside any Claude Code session, so it never sees the configured value — passing it explicitly is what keeps the two in step, not a convenience. This is the *only* screenshot task the skill relies on. (`daily_exports/` is a separate, optional Cowork-sandbox bridge — not part of screenshot capture.)

> **If a previous `WorkScreenshots` task was registered as Administrator**, re-running setup from a normal shell fails with `Access is denied`. Re-running it *elevated* clears the error and recreates the same problem — the replacement is owned by `BUILTIN\Administrators` as well, so the next ordinary re-register fails the same way. Do it in two steps: `Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName WorkScreenshots -Confirm:$false` from an **elevated** PowerShell, then run the setup script from a **normal** one. That is what leaves the task owned by the user, so no later update needs elevation.

### Health check — captures stopped

A dead capture task fails *silently*: the task stays `Ready`, no error surfaces, and the
only symptom is a screenshot folder that stops part-way through a day (which looks
identical to the user having stopped work — see `SKILL.md` Step 3).

```powershell
Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName WorkScreenshots | Select-Object LastRunTime, LastTaskResult, NextRunTime
```

`LastTaskResult` of `0` is healthy. **`0x80070002` (file not found) means the interpreter
path moved** — the task action stores an absolute path, so a Python upgrade, reinstall, or
switch between per-machine and per-user install breaks it, and every trigger from that
moment on fails. Confirm with `(Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName WorkScreenshots).Actions`, then
re-run `setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1` to re-register against the current interpreter.
Setup prefers the version-independent launcher (`pyw.exe`) precisely so this survives a
reinstall; a task registered by an older setup may still hold a versioned path. Setup also
probes every candidate with a real import before trusting it — a 0-byte Store stub or a
split install that can't reach its own libraries is skipped, and `-PythonExe <path>` pins
an interpreter explicitly when probing picks wrong.

Verify the fix by running the task once (`Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName WorkScreenshots`)
and confirming new PNGs appear for every monitor.

## First-run: the workspace

The `setup` skill deliberately does not build this — it covers only what a person has to do by hand, and this is not that. It belongs to this skill's first run, which is where a user arrives with no `Timesheets/` at all.

Ask which folder should be the workspace (the current directory is the usual answer), then from a clone of the repo run `install/setup_workspace.ps1 [-Workspace <path>]` (POSIX: `install/setup_workspace.sh [<path>]`).

**Most users have no clone**, and the script is a convenience rather than a requirement. Without one, do the same two things by hand. Create three directories:

- `Timesheets/` — `.context.md` plus optional per-day markdown audit files.
- `daily_exports/` — optional historical ActivityWatch dumps, the fallback when the server is unreachable.
- `.mcp/` — the cached catalogs, refreshed on demand.

Then copy this skill's own `references/context.md.example` to `Timesheets/.context.md`, resolving it from where `SKILL.md` was read — and never over an existing one, which is the next section's subject. That is the whole of what the script does.

If the workspace is not the folder Claude Code starts in, set `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE` (`/plugin configure billables`, or `.env` on an exported install) *after* the folder exists, for the reason §"After a machine reimage or replacement" item 2 gives: the value is returned verbatim with no existence check, so a path that isn't there breaks every catalog lookup while the Harvest-API-only scripts keep working and mask it.

## First-run: `Timesheets/.context.md`

If `Timesheets/.context.md` doesn't exist:

1. Read `references/context.md.example` as the template.
2. Walk the user through filling it in — interactively, one section at a time. Ask about: their internal colleagues, the clients they bill, the signal types each client has (Edge profile, codebase, ChatGPT project, etc.), known external contacts, and any personal-browsing patterns to exclude.
3. Save the result as `Timesheets/.context.md`.
4. Tell the user they can always edit this file directly — the skill re-reads it every run.

**Leave the Work kinds table until the credentials are in.** It is the one section with no shipped default — it says what *this* user's provider account calls each of the seven neutral work kinds, and no two accounts agree. Once the configuration below is set, refresh the catalogs and read the `task_assignments[]` names out of `.mcp/harvest_assignments.json`, then offer those. Asking the user to type their own task names from memory produces a table that doesn't match their account.

## First-run: configuration

Everything the skill needs to know about *this machine and account* is declared in the plugin manifest, so a fresh install asks for it once and never again:

| Key | Required | Unset means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID` | yes | every Harvest command stops, naming this key |
| `HARVEST_API_KEY` | yes | as above |
| `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` | no | this machine's own zone, and every script that reads a day labels it *derived from this machine* — carry that label into the timesheet's Notes (`references/output-format.md` § Conventions). Where the machine's zone cannot be read, or names a zone this interpreter cannot load, `afk_blocks` / `activity_timeline` refuse to date a day and `harvest_post` / `harvest_patch` refuse to create or move a clock, naming this key — never a guessed offset |
| `TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL` | no | `http://localhost:5600` |
| `TIMESHEET_SCREENSHOTS_DIR` | no | `~/Pictures/WorkScreenshots` |
| `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE` | no | the directory Claude Code is run from, if it looks like a workspace |
| `TIMESHEET_OUTLOOK_CALENDAR` | no | the calendar is not read. `true` — the one spelling of on — reads the default calendar in classic Outlook, Windows only |

The user sets them with **`/plugin configure billables`**. The two Harvest fields are declared *sensitive*, so Claude Code stores them in its own credential store — not in any file in the plugin, and not in `settings.json`. A plugin update cannot carry them off and there is nothing for this skill to git-ignore.

Be accurate about *where*, when telling a user. That store is the OS keychain on **macOS** only; on Windows and Linux it is `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, a file in the home directory protected by file permissions rather than by a keychain. This plugin is Windows-first, so for most of its users the token is on disk — saying "keychain" invites them to treat their home directory as safe to sync or share.

Every script reads them through the one seam, `scripts/skill_config.py`: a per-command flag, then the skill's `.env`, then the process environment (which is where the harness's values arrive), then the script's own default. That module's docstring carries the precedence and the reasoning for it.

1. Visit https://id.getharvest.com/developers. Note the numeric **Account ID** at the top, then create a **Personal Access Token**.
2. Run `/plugin configure billables` and paste both in, along with an IANA timezone name (`Europe/London`, `Pacific/Auckland`). There is deliberately no default zone — a guessed one dates the whole timesheet wrong without failing.
3. Restart the session, or start a new one: the values reach the scripts through the plugin's SessionStart hook, which runs at the start of a session.
4. Verify: `python scripts/harvest_list.py YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD` for today should print existing entries without an auth error. A day with no entries prints `(no time entries from … to …)` on stderr — exit 0 plus that notice is the success case, distinguishable from a run that silently did nothing.

**Exported install** (the shared Agent Skills export that `install/install_skill.ps1` generates, rather than `/plugin install`): there is no manifest for a harness to ask from, so the same keys go in a `.env` at the skill root instead — copy `.env.example` → `.env` (same folder as `SKILL.md`; it is `.gitignore`d) and fill it in. That file grants full access to the user's Harvest account: never commit it, and never include it when sharing the skill folder with a coworker — give them `.env.example` and let them fill in their own.

**Token scope:** a member-scope PAT is sufficient (the skill only reads self entries and posts via `/time_entries`). Admin endpoints like `/projects` and `/clients` would 403 on a member PAT — the skill never calls those; it uses `/users/me/project_assignments` via the cached `.mcp/harvest_assignments*.json`.

**Windows and the timezone database:** `zoneinfo` is stdlib, but on Windows the IANA data it reads is not shipped with Python. If a run reports it could not load the configured zone, `py -m pip install tzdata` for the interpreter the skill uses. The message says so; it does not fall back to a guessed offset.

### When the configuration does not arrive

The user filled in `/plugin configure billables`, started a new session, and a script still says the value is missing. Three causes, in the order worth checking. **Causes 1 and 3 look identical to the user and need opposite things**, so separate them before recommending anything — and separate them by *re-running the failing command through the Bash tool*, not by probing for a shell. If the value appears, it was cause 1. If the Bash tool will not run at all, it is cause 3. If Bash runs and the value is still missing, it is cause 2 or the setting was never filled in.

Do not use `sh --version` for this. A default Git for Windows puts only `Git\cmd` on `PATH` while `sh.exe` lives in `Git\bin`, and Claude Code finds its shell by its own resolution rather than through `PATH` — so `sh --version` fails on a machine whose Bash tool works perfectly, which routes a cause-1 user to cause 3's fix. That was the advice here until it was measured.

**1. The command did not come from the Bash tool.** The values are published as a POSIX shell fragment, and Claude Code applies that to **Bash** tool calls alone — its PowerShell tool is given no equivalent and loads no profile. So a script the model happens to run through PowerShell reports the setting missing on a machine that is configured perfectly well, and the *hook ran correctly*: this is not cause 3 and Git Bash is already installed. Fix: re-run the same command through the Bash tool. Nothing needs restarting and nothing needs installing. Confirmed empirically: a value published by a SessionStart hook read back as set in a Bash tool call and unset in a PowerShell one, in the same session.

The error says so itself, and says it for cause 3 as well, because the two are indistinguishable from inside the process: the publishing hook exports a marker alongside the values, so a message that finds neither knows only that the fragment did not arrive. It names both causes and says a new session will not help. The lasting fix is to read configured values in Bash and hand PowerShell the resolved literal — `SKILL.md` "Running the scripts" carries it.

**2. A leftover `.env` is outranking it.** The seam's precedence is flag → `.env` → process environment, and the plugin's values arrive in the *environment*. Before this release the two routes carried different keys, so the order never bit; now they carry the same six, and a `.env` left over from an exported install silently wins. The tell is a rotated credential that still 401s, or a timezone change that has no effect. Check for a `.env` beside `SKILL.md`; on a plugin install, delete it — configuration belongs in the dialog, and a file inside the plugin folder is carried off by the next update anyway.

**3. The session hook could not run.** The declared values reach *hook* processes only; the plugin's `hooks/publish_plugin_config.sh` republishes them into the session so the scripts see them. Claude Code runs hook commands through Git Bash on Windows — and through **PowerShell** when Git Bash is not installed, where `sh` is not a command and the hook cannot start. The symptom is precisely "I configured everything and nothing is configured". Fix: `winget install Git.Git`, then start a new session. Confirm before installing anything the way the paragraph above already prescribes: re-run the failing command through the Bash tool — if the Bash tool will not run at all, that is cause 3.

Cause 1 and cause 3 are not the same gap and share no fix. In 3 the hook never started, so nothing was published to any shell; in 1 the hook ran and wrote the fragment correctly, and one shell was not given it. Re-running through the Bash tool is what separates them, per the paragraph above.

None of the three is a reason to hand the scripts a guessed value. `--utc-offset <hours>` gets one run done while the cause is being fixed; the credentials have no equivalent, and shouldn't.

## AW host discovery (one-time per machine)

ActivityWatch buckets are hostname-suffixed. On first run for a user, call `GET <activity-url>/api/0/buckets/` and identify the live bucket id for `aw-watcher-window`, `aw-watcher-afk`, etc. (e.g. `aw-watcher-window_HOSTNAME`). Cache them in `.context.md` under an "AW buckets" section so future sessions can skip the discovery.

## ActivityWatch categories (the plugin keeps them current)

`activity_timeline.py` reads the category rules live from `/api/0/settings`: a client-level regex matched against the window's app name and title, which is where the timeline's client labels come from. They are never project- or work-item-level, and they are a first-pass signal only, not 100% certain.

**The plugin owns them (#69), so this is not a section to act on by hand.** `scripts/category_rules.py` compiles them from the signals declared per client in `.context.md`, refuses any that matches nothing or an implausible share of your real window titles, orders them so the most specific signal wins, and copies the previous set into `.mcp/` before it writes. Step 2 of the workflow checks whether they are still current for `.context.md` and rebuilds them when they are not. What that means here:

- **A missing client is a missing *signal*, not a missing rule.** Add it to that client's section in `.context.md` and the next run compiles it; editing the rule in the settings UI instead is a change the next rebuild discards.
- **A rule is never the client's name alone**, and never a bare client code either. The gate refuses both: the first matching rule wins, so a rule that broad takes the label off a correct one. A profile tag is matched in its brackets, `\[ACME\]`, and every other signal is matched more specifically than that — a work-item prefix, an environment address, an editor workspace — with the browser, editor or meeting application anchored into the pattern where the signal implies one.
- **A placeholder (`New class`, `FILL ME`) or any other rule the plugin did not write is left alone**, so it is still yours to delete in the settings UI. `--inspect` lists every rule with the share of recent titles it matches and marks which are which.
- **A managed rule you edited or damaged by hand is recoverable, and `--inspect` is where you see it.** The staleness check reads two local files and never the rules themselves, so an edit made in the settings dialog does not make a run report `STALE`; `--inspect` marks that rule `EDITED since it was written`, and running the compile again puts it back from `.context.md`. The rule set as it was before any write of this plugin's is in `<workspace>/.mcp/aw-categories-<timestamp>.json`.
- **A regex on window titles fundamentally cannot catch *work-content* overrides** (work for client A done in client B's browser profile). Those belong in `.context.md` under the relevant client and are resolved during classification — which is also why a profile tag belongs only on a profile dedicated to one client.

## After a machine reimage or replacement

A reimage/replacement machine keeps the same user profile path but breaks several things at once, from one underlying cause (new OS install, new hostname):

1. **Scheduled screenshot task points at a dead interpreter.** Its `Execute` path is whatever Python was installed on the old image — check `Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName WorkScreenshots` for a non-zero `LastTaskResult` (file-not-found is `2147942402`). If the interpreter path changed, `Set-ScheduledTaskAction` with the new `pythonw.exe` path, then re-run `scripts/screenshot_capture.py` once by hand to confirm it isn't *also* missing `mss`/`Pillow` (a fresh Python install has neither) — `pip install mss Pillow` for that interpreter if the capture log shows `No module named ...`.
2. **A configured `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE` may point at a path that no longer exists.** `find_workspace()` returns it verbatim with no existence check — and neither does the plugin's configuration dialog, whose `directory` type offers a picker but accepts a path that isn't there — so a stale value silently breaks every catalog lookup (`harvest_lookup.py`, `refresh_catalogs.py`) while Harvest-API-only scripts (`harvest_list.py`) keep working and mask the problem. Verify the path with `Test-Path`, not by assuming a script's success means the workspace resolved correctly.
3. **`pac auth` profiles don't carry over.** `pac auth list` after a reimage typically keeps client-environment profiles (if the user re-logged into those separately) but drops the internal-CRM profile the skill's `.env` names — `refresh_catalogs.py`'s Dataverse half fails with `AuthProfileNameDoesNotExist`. Recreating it (`pac auth create --name <PAC_PROFILE> --environment <DATAVERSE_URL>`) is an interactive login — confirm with the user before running it, per the Dataverse-headless convention in their `.context.md`.
4. **AW hostname suffix changes** (e.g. `HOST-OLD` → `HOST-NEW`) — no action needed: `aw_client.py`'s `pick_bucket()` already prefers a suffixed bucket over an unsuffixed leftover and breaks ties among suffixed candidates by `last_updated`, not alphabetically. A stale hostname hardcoded anywhere in `.context.md` prose is still worth correcting so it doesn't mislead a reader.

## Ongoing `.context.md` updates

When a run discovers a *new* fact that should live in `.context.md` (a new client signal, a new colleague, a new exclusion pattern, a clarified billing preference), **propose** the addition at the end of the session. Show the user the exact diff and ask before writing. Don't silently mutate their file.

"""Regressions for the findings of the 2026-08-14 code review.

Each test here failed before its fix. They are kept together rather than filed into the
per-module edge files because what they share is provenance: a reviewer reading the code
found each one, and grouping them makes the review auditable — you can re-run exactly the
set that was reported.

The unifying shape of the serious ones is **a plausible-looking wrong answer**: an empty
timeline that means "the watcher died" but reads as "no work happened", a coverage
summary over 100%, a PATCH that silently drops half its input. None of them raise.

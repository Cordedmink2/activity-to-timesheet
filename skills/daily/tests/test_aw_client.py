"""Tests for the shared ActivityWatch client.

`afk_blocks.py` and `activity_timeline.py` both read the same local AW server and
carried byte-identical copies of the request, dedupe and timestamp helpers. Two
copies means a fix to one silently leaves the other wrong, so these cover the
shared module and then assert both scripts really use it rather than their own.

The zone a day is read in was this module's too until #36 and is now `timezone.py`'s,
because the provider half needs the same arithmetic; `test_timezone.py` covers it.

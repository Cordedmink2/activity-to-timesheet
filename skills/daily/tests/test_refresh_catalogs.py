"""Guards that the Dataverse config stays environment-driven.

These used to read the script as *text* — `'DV_URL = setting("DATAVERSE_URL")' in SOURCE`,
and index arithmetic over the string to prove one statement came before another — because
importing the module resolved the workspace at import time and exited when there wasn't
one. The tests could not run the code, so they described it instead, and a rename broke
them with behaviour unchanged while a behaviour change slipped past untouched.

The module imports cleanly now, so they call it — the plain `import refresh_catalogs` at
the top of this file is itself the evidence that the import-time exit is gone, which is
why no test here asserts it separately. `test_config_seam.py` holds the general rule for
every bundled script. What is still asserted against the source
is only what is genuinely a property of the source: that no tenant URL is written down
anywhere in `scripts/`, which is a claim about every file rather than about this one's
behaviour.

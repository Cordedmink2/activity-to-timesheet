"""Which module in `scripts/` may import which.

Three rules, and each one had been broken by a script that read perfectly well on its own:

1. **A provider script never imports the activity-source client.** `harvest_post.py` and
   `harvest_patch.py` imported `aw_client` for timezone arithmetic — the one import edge
   that ran the wrong way, since an adapter that reaches into the activity source is not
   behind a boundary at all. ADR-0006 records it; #36 removed it.
2. **Nothing imports an entry point.** `harvest_patch.py` imported `harvest_post.py` for a
   message and a helper, which is the shape `harvest_write.py` exists to make unnecessary:
   "not a script … everything a write has in common happens here, once". A module that
   imports a script imports its command line, its usage text and whatever else it grows.
3. **The shared ground stays neutral.** `timezone.py` is imported by both halves, so an
   import of either half from inside it would put the two back in contact through it.

Read out of the syntax tree rather than by importing: an import edge is a property of the
source, and asking the question of the text answers it for a module the suite has already
loaded in some other order.

"""Tests for the shared zone arithmetic.

The zone a day is read in, the bounds it gives the day, and the two dates a year on which
a clock reading is not a straight fact. These lived in `test_aw_client.py` until #36, when
the arithmetic moved out of the activity-source client and into `timezone.py` — both halves
of the skill need it, and the provider scripts were importing that client to reach it. Not
an assertion here changed in the move.

The two day-reading scripts are imported at the bottom, to assert they really use the
shared functions rather than their own; the provider half's use of the same module is in
`test_edge_harvest_api.py`, at the refusal that reads it.

"""Contracts every command-line script in this skill has to honour.

The scripts are run by a model reading their stdout, so their failure modes are part of
their interface. Four promises, made in the module docstrings and the SKILL.md guards:

* bad input produces `ERR …` on stderr and a non-zero exit — never a Python traceback,
  which reads to the model as "the script is broken" and sends it debugging the tool
  instead of fixing the argument;
* `--json` means JSON, so the output can be parsed without sniffing it first;
* the scripts import cleanly under a captured stdout, or they cannot be tested at all;
* a script that writes to the provider writes nothing without `--confirm`, and says what
  it would have written instead.

Each test here was written against the failing behaviour first.

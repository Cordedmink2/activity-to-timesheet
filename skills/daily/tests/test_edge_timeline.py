"""Edge cases in the *content* view — the one the skill reads a client's name off.

`activity_timeline.py` does not produce a number anybody bills directly; it produces
the merged, category-tagged picture the skill reasons from when it decides which client
a stretch of the day belonged to. So its failure mode is not "the total is 6 minutes
out", it is "a span that touched two clients was silently handed to one of them", or
"a locked screen was folded into the block either side of it and billed".

`tests/test_activity_timeline.py` covers the four happy paths and `tests/test_scenarios.py`
covers whole days end to end. This file covers the seams between them: the exact
boundaries of the two constants, the shapes real watchers emit that no scenario contains,
the ways a settings file can be half-broken, and the rendering rules that decide what the
model ever gets to see.

# An underscore for the same reason, and because leaving it out is worse than a plain miss:

    A flag counts when the source contains a string literal that is *exactly* a flag —
    which is the same thing as the script comparing an argument against it. That covers all
    three parsing shapes this skill ships without knowing which is which: argparse's
    `add_argument("--json")`, `harvest_patch.py`'s `FLAGS` table, and the bare
    `a != "--by-day"` filter in `harvest_list.py`. A flag named inside a longer string — a
    usage line, a module docstring — is documentation and does not count, so the literal has
    to match end to end.

    Read as text rather than by importing the module and inspecting its parser, which is
    what this test was first imagined as. Only four of the eleven scripts use argparse, and
    all four build the parser inside `main()`, so an import alone reaches no parser: that
    route means refactoring four scripts to expose a builder and still leaves the three
    hand-rolled parsers uncovered. The trade is that this cannot see a flag assembled at
    runtime; nothing here assembles one, and a test for the inventory being *complete* is
    worth more than one that is exact about a shape nobody uses.

    Two blind spots worth naming, since both look like holes and only one is:

    * `action=argparse.BooleanOptionalAction` on `--full` would make `--no-full` parseable
      with that string appearing nowhere in the source, so the inventory would never be
      asked for it. That is the same class as runtime assembly and a good deal likelier to
      be reached here — negating a boolean flag is the ordinary next edit to one.
    * `-h` / `--help` is accepted by every argparse script and has no literal either. That
      one is a correct omission: nobody wants `--help` in the inventory. A short option
      added beside a long one (`-j` for `--json`) is not held for the same reason, and the
      long form it accompanies still is.

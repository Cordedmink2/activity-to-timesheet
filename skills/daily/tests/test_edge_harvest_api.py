"""Edge cases of the three Harvest CLIs and the client they share.

Everything here asserts on what actually went over the wire — the recorded request body,
the query string, the headers — rather than on what the script said it did. The two are
not the same thing, and the gap between them is where the expensive bugs live: a body
that says `hours` instead of `started_time` still prints `OK 12345`.

No `subprocess` anywhere. `run_cli` runs `main()` in-process so conftest's hermeticity
fixture still holds; a subprocess would read the real `.env` and post real time entries
to a client's timesheet.

Every invocation here carries `--confirm`, including the ones asserting a refusal. The
confirmation gate would block all of them on its own, so a guard test run without the flag
would pass whether or not the guard it names still exists. The gate's own contract is in
`test_cli_contracts.py`.

# ======================================================================================
#
# Reconciliation asks one question of a month: which days were never billed, and which
# were billed short. That is arithmetic over the same listing, and the reason it lives
# here rather than in a model's head is the same reason the day skeleton does — a total
# summed by eye off a hundred printed rows is wrong occasionally and silently, and the
# cost is a day billed twice or a day left unbilled forever.
#
# The zero-entry rows are the whole point of the mode: a day with no entries is *absent*
# from the per-entry listing, and absent is exactly what a gap looks like.

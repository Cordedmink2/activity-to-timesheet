"""Shared fixtures — and, first, the guard that makes this suite safe to run.

## Why the hermeticity fixture exists

This skill's scripts talk to two live systems that are *running on the machine the
tests run on*:

* **ActivityWatch** on `http://localhost:5600`. A test that forgets to stub it reads
  the user's real event stream: it passes today, fails next Tuesday, and asserts
  nothing about the code.
* **Harvest**, with real credentials sitting in `.env` at the skill root. A test that
  reaches `harvest_client.request()` unstubbed can **create a real time entry on a
  client-facing timesheet**. That is the one genuinely dangerous failure mode here.

So `_hermetic` is autouse: it points both base addresses at a port nothing listens on and
blanks the credential sources. An unstubbed call then fails immediately and visibly
instead of touching production. Tests that *want* a server ask for `live_aw` /
`live_harvest`, which point the same two at a local fake — the activity source through
`TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL`, Harvest through the `API_BASE` constant. See `_hermetic` below
for why those are two mechanisms rather than one.

**Corollary: never shell out to a script with `subprocess`.** A subprocess inherits none
of this and reads the real `.env`. Use `support.run_cli`, which runs `main()` in-process.

    """No test reaches a real ActivityWatch, a real Harvest, or the real `.env`.

    One `setattr` blanks the credential file because `skill_config` is the only module
    that opens it — a property `test_config_seam.py` asserts rather than assumes, since
    a second reader appearing elsewhere in `scripts/` would leave this guard covering
    half of what it claims to.

    The activity source is redirected through its *setting* rather than by reassigning a
    module global. `aw_client` used to freeze the address into `AW_BASE` at import, so the
    only way to move it was to reach in and overwrite it; now `resolve_base()` runs per
    request and reads `TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL` like anything else. That is the safer of the
    two mechanisms as well as the tidier one — a `setattr` on a name that has been renamed
    away raises, but a `setenv` on a key nothing reads any more fails silently and points
    the suite back at a real ActivityWatch. `test_harness.py` holds that line by asserting
    the guard works, rather than trusting that it is wired up.

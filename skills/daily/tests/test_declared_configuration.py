"""What a user can change without editing a script, and what happens when they haven't.

Two layers meet here, and the division between them is the point.

**Machine and account facts** are declared plugin configuration — the Harvest credentials,
the timezone, the ActivityWatch address. The install asks once, the harness stores them,
and they arrive as ordinary environment variables that `skill_config.setting()` resolves.
The tests below cover the two the scripts newly read, and the failure a user meets when a
required one is absent: the timezone, which used to be a silent `default=12.0` — every
other user's day dated in New Zealand, with nothing on screen saying so.

**Preferences** stay in the user's own workspace, as prose in `context.md` that the model
reads and passes on the command line. The tunables that decide whether a block counts as
active, and how much noise is folded away, were settable nowhere: they were module
constants, so changing one meant editing a shipped script — which an update then
overwrites. Each now has a flag, with the constant as its default, so nothing about a run
that passes none of them changes.

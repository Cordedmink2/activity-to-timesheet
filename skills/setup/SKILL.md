description: Walk a first-time user through the parts of installing this plugin that only a person can do — installing the activity source, adding the browser extension, tagging each browser profile with a client code, building the category rules, getting the screenshot task past endpoint security, and settling whether the Outlook calendar is read — verifying each one before moving on. User-invoked.
compatibility: Windows-first. Reads a running ActivityWatch server over HTTP (default http://localhost:5600). Step 5 registers a Windows scheduled task and needs PowerShell plus Python 3.10+; on macOS and Linux there is no screenshot capture to set up and that step is skipped. Step 6 is entered everywhere, and reports the calendar off on any machine without classic Outlook. Needs a harness that can execute local commands and make HTTP requests. Posts nothing to any timesheet provider.

# setup

The other skills in this plugin fail loudly — a script exits non-zero and says why. The install does not. Every step below can look like it worked and have done nothing: an extension added to the wrong browser profile, a category rule that matches no title, a scheduled task registered against an interpreter that no longer exists. The symptom arrives days later as a timesheet with nothing in it, and by then nobody remembers which step it was.

So this skill is not a list of instructions. It is a list of instructions **with a check after each one**, and it does not move on until the check comes back. Run it top to bottom.

## What this covers, and what it does not

It covers only the residue a person has to do. Everything a machine can do belongs elsewhere and is not repeated here:

- **The values** — credentials, timezone, paths — are declared plugin configuration, collected once at install. This skill checks whether they are *present* and routes a gap to `/plugin configure billables`. It never asks for one, and never asks the user to type a token into the conversation, which is written to disk in the session transcript. If the user pastes one in anyway, say so at the time and suggest they rotate it before that transcript is shared anywhere — the dialog is the fix going forward, but the token that has already been written down is not fixed by using the dialog next time.

  **The check is the other way a token reaches the transcript, and it is the way that has actually happened.** A command run to find out whether a value is set writes its own output to the same transcript, so *no command in this skill may expand a credential into its output* — the answer is `set` or `MISSING`, never the value. **Use the probe given below rather than composing one.** The version this replaces paired the two default-substitution forms in one string, on the reading that each supplies a word for its own case; in fact only one of the pair substitutes a word, and the other substitutes the variable itself, so the line printed `set` followed by the user's API key. Nothing failed and nothing looked wrong. If a run has already printed a credential, treat it exactly as a pasted token above: say so at the time, and tell the user to rotate it.
- **The workspace** — `Timesheets/`, the catalogs, and the `.context.md` describing the user's own clients and conventions — belongs to the `daily` skill's own first run. Point at it at the end; do not build it here.

Six steps, and then a stated finish.

## Finding the files this skill needs

Steps 5 and 6 run scripts that ship with the `daily` skill, in a directory beside this one. Resolve **this** skill's folder from where this `SKILL.md` was read, then look for a sibling named `daily` — or, in the shared export, `billables-daily`, because that directory is flat and every skill in it is prefixed. Check which of the two exists rather than guessing; a wrong prefix fails as "file not found", which reads like a broken install rather than a wrong path.

## Before you start

Four things, in parallel, before step 1:

1. **Is the configuration set?** Run exactly this, through the **Bash** tool — the declared values are published into the session as a POSIX shell fragment, so PowerShell reports `MISSING` for a machine that is configured perfectly well:

   ```bash
   for k in HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID HARVEST_API_KEY TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE; do
     if [ -n "${!k:-}" ]; then echo "$k=set"; else echo "$k=MISSING"; fi
   done
   ```

   Three lines of `set` or `MISSING` and nothing else. Do not collect the values here and do not block on them — steps 1 to 5 need none of them, and step 6 needs only the timezone and says so itself when it is missing, so carry on and re-check at the finish. Leave the `:-` in `${!k:-}` alone: under `set -euo pipefail`, which some harnesses wrap every command in, the bare form aborts the shell on the first unset key — so the machine that most needs an answer is the one that gets a shell error instead, and a run that gets a shell error writes its own replacement.

   **If there is no Bash tool on this machine, do not translate the probe into PowerShell.** No PowerShell command can answer this question on any machine: the fragment is POSIX and is applied to Bash calls only, so PowerShell reports nothing set whether or not the user has configured anything (issue #28). And a box with no Git Bash is one where the publishing hook could not run either, so nothing was published to either shell. That makes the answer known in advance — treat all three as `MISSING`, skip to the Git Bash question below, and never compose a check to confirm it. Composing one is what leaked a key.

   **An absent value here has two causes and they need different things.** Either it was never filled in, or it was filled in and the session hook that republishes it did not run — on Windows that hook needs Git Bash, and without it the values reach nothing. So do not report "not configured" from an empty environment alone. Ask whether the user has filled in `/plugin configure billables`; if they have, the answer is a new session, and if a new session does not fix it, `references/first-run.md` in the `daily` skill owns that diagnosis. If they have not, that is the thing to ask for — the dialog, never the conversation.

   **On an exported install there is no dialog to send them to.** A harness that is not Claude Code has no plugin manifest to hold configuration, so the same keys live in a `.env` beside the sibling skill's `SKILL.md`, and `/plugin configure billables` is a command that does not exist there. Work out which install this is at the same time as resolving the sibling directory below, and route a gap to copying that skill's `.env.example` to `.env` instead. Either way the value is written to a file by the user, not typed into the conversation.

   The probe above cannot see that file, so on an exported install a `MISSING` means nothing until the `.env` has been checked too — and it is checked by **key name only**, never by reading the file out: `grep -c '^HARVEST_API_KEY=[^[:space:]]' <daily-skill>/.env` and the same for the other two keys. A count is the whole answer. The trailing character class is the whole point of the pattern rather than a detail of it: `.env.example` ships every one of these keys already present and empty, so a user who copies the template and stops has all three key names in the file and no values, and a pattern that counts the name alone reports a fully configured install. Blank is unset everywhere else in this plugin, and it has to be unset here too. `cat`ting a `.env` puts the key in the transcript by a different route than the one above and costs the user the same rotation.
2. **Which address is the activity source on?** `TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL` if it is set, otherwise `http://localhost:5600`. Use that address everywhere below.
3. **Is there a working interpreter?** On Windows, prefer `py` over a bare `python`: the bare name is often the Store app-execution alias, a 0-byte stub whose tell is a help message about installing from the Store and exit code 49. Probe it — `py -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)"` then `py -m pip --version` — rather than trusting that the name resolves. An interpreter that exists and even imports its stdlib can still be broken: `Could not find platform independent libraries` on stderr is a split install whose `sys.prefix` doesn't resolve, so pip and site-packages are unreachable. Both matter most at step 5, where a broken interpreter and a blocked one look identical, and the first coworker install of this pipeline went to IT over exactly that confusion.
4. **Is there a shell to run step 5's script in?** A stock Windows box has only Windows PowerShell 5.1, so `pwsh` may not exist. Either have the user install it (`winget install Microsoft.PowerShell`) or substitute `powershell.exe -File ...` — the scripts run under 5.1. Under 5.1, quote home-relative paths as `"$HOME/..."`: a bare `~` is passed through literally to a native command rather than expanded, so the path resolves to a directory named `~` and the failure reads as "file not found".

## Steps

### 1. The activity source is installed and running

**Do** — ask the user to install ActivityWatch and launch it. On Windows `winget install ActivityWatch.ActivityWatch` is the shortest route; https://activitywatch.net/downloads/ is the fallback and the only route on macOS and Linux.

**Verify** — `GET <activity-url>/api/0/buckets/` returns JSON holding a key that starts `aw-watcher-window_` and one that starts `aw-watcher-afk_`. Note the hostname suffix on those keys; the buckets are hostname-scoped and the rest of this run needs the window bucket's full id.

**If it fails** — a refused connection means it is not running (the tray icon, not the installer, is the thing to check). HTML or a 404 instead of JSON means something else holds the port. If the user runs the server on another machine or port, that address is `TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL`: have them set it through `/plugin configure billables` rather than passing it per-command forever, and use the new address for the rest of this run.

### 2. The browser extension is rewriting window titles

Window titles are the only client signal that survives into the activity stream. Without the extension a browser title is a page name, which says nothing about which client the page belongs to.

**Do** — ask the user to install **URL in Title** (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/url-in-title/ignpacbgnbnkaiooknalneoeladjnfgb) in **each browser profile they work in**. Extensions are per-profile; installing it once does not cover the others.

**Verify** — have the user browse for a minute in a work profile, then read recent events: `GET <activity-url>/api/0/buckets/<window-bucket>/events?limit=1000`. Keep the events whose `data.app` is a browser, and check that at least one `data.title` carries a hostname — a `host.tld` pattern such as `example.com`. Do not expect all of them to: a profile without the extension, and any window opened before it was installed, legitimately have none. **Zero across every browser event is the failure**, and it localises to this step rather than to the tagging in step 3.

**If it fails** — the usual cause is the extension living in one profile while the user browsed in another. Ask which profile they just used and check it directly. A managed browser can also refuse the install outright: on Edge or Chrome under policy, the extension has to be allow-listed by ID, which is a precise request — see `references/endpoint-security.md`.

### 3. Each work profile tags its titles with a client code

**Do** — explain the arrangement: one browser profile per client, and in each profile the URL-in-Title format appends that client's short code in brackets, e.g. `{title}-{hostname}{path}{args}{hash} - [ACME]`. Help the user pick codes that are short and collision-resistant; write down which profile carries which code, because step 4 has to agree with it exactly and the end of this run hands the list to the `daily` skill.

**Verify** — from the same recent-events read as step 2, check the browser titles for a bracketed code, `\[[A-Za-z0-9-]{2,12}\]`. Go through the codes the user named one at a time: **each has to appear in at least one real title.** A code with zero matches is a profile whose format string was never saved — which is invisible in the options page, because it shows what was typed rather than what was stored.

**If it fails** — the format was saved in a different profile from the one browsed in; or it was typed and the page left without saving. Re-check per profile, not in aggregate: an aggregate pass hides the one profile that is wrong, and that client's whole day comes back uncategorized.

### 4. The category rules match the tags

**Do** — walk the user through the activity source's own UI (`<activity-url>` → Settings → Categories): one category per client, with a **Regex** rule matching the bracketed code, e.g. `\[ACME\]`.

**Verify** — do not trust the UI having saved. `GET <activity-url>/api/0/settings` and read `classes[]`. Each entry carries a `name` (a list — the category and its parents) and a `rule`. **Only test the entries whose `rule.type` is `"regex"`**: a grouping category has `{"type": "none"}` and no `regex` at all, and reaching for a field that isn't there turns a healthy configuration into an error. Compile each regex, honouring its `ignore_case`, and run it against the browser titles collected in step 2.

Judge the result against **the codes the user demonstrated in this session**, not against every rule on the machine: each of those must match at least one real title. A rule that matches nothing is only a defect if its code is one the user just showed you working — on a machine that has been running a while, a zero usually means that client simply wasn't worked on inside the sampled window, and calling it broken sends the user to fix something that is fine. A leftover placeholder (`New class`, `FILL ME`) is a defect either way.

**If it fails** — first separate "the rules are wrong" from "there are no rules to read". The settings endpoint can be absent or return an empty `classes[]` on some versions of the activity source, and the bundled reader is written to survive exactly that; an empty list is not a saved-rules failure and sending the user back to the UI to re-enter rules they already entered wastes their time. Confirm the endpoint answered and returned entries before diagnosing any of the below.

Then, in order of how often it is the answer: a bracketed rule against a bare tag, or a bare rule against a bracketed tag, which matches nothing and silently leaves every block uncategorized; spaces inside an alternation (`Contract | ACME` requires the literal spaces); a rule saved for a code no profile actually emits, which is really a step 3 failure surfacing here. The fix is to make the tag and the rule agree — either end may move, as long as both do. If this install carries `demo/tag-rule-demo.html`, opening it shows each of these failure modes live and is faster than explaining them.

### 5. The screenshot task is registered and actually capturing

Screenshots are what disambiguate generic activity into the right client, so this is a required step on Windows, not an optional one. On macOS and Linux there is no capture pipeline shipped: say so, and skip to the finish.

**Do** — if a `WorkScreenshots` task already exists, read it first: `(Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName WorkScreenshots).Actions.Arguments`. Registration replaces it with one built from the script's own defaults, so any non-default `-StartTime`, `-EndTime`, `-IntervalSeconds` or capture directory in there is the user's and has to be passed through again — nothing carries it for you. Someone migrating from a hand-installed copy is the likely case, and a task silently back on 08:30–20:00 every 2.5 minutes surfaces a fortnight later as a day with no evidence on it.

Then run the `daily` skill's `scripts/setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1`, resolved as described above. It installs Pillow and mss if they are missing and registers one scheduled task. If `TIMESHEET_SCREENSHOTS_DIR` is configured, pass the same path as `-ScreenshotsDir`: the task runs outside any session and never sees the configured value, so passing it explicitly is what keeps the reader and the writer pointed at the same folder.

**Read that value in the Bash tool** — `python "<daily>/scripts/screenshot_capture.py" --where` — and put the result on `-ScreenshotsDir`, **quoted**: `-ScreenshotsDir "C:\My Shots"`, because an unquoted path with a space binds only up to the space and errors. This `.ps1` is necessarily run through PowerShell, and the configuration reaches Bash tool calls alone (the same reason the probe in "Before you start" is a Bash command), so read there it comes back empty, the task registers against `~\Pictures\WorkScreenshots`, and the capture writes where nothing reads — the divergence passing it explicitly is meant to close. Use that command rather than echoing the variable: it applies the full precedence and expands a `~`, and it is the same resolution the capture script itself writes by.

**Verify** — three checks, and the second is the one that catches a stale install:

1. `Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName WorkScreenshots` returns without error.
2. `(Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName WorkScreenshots).Actions` — read the `Execute` and `Arguments` back and confirm they name **this** install's `screenshot_capture.py` and a current interpreter. A machine that once had a hand-installed copy keeps a task pointing at the old path; it registers, reports `Ready`, and captures into a folder nobody reads. On a plugin install the stored path names a *versioned* cache folder, and the session-start hook re-points it at the current version each time a session starts — so a plugin-install task still naming a superseded version usually means the hook is not running on this machine, which is the same gap as configuration not arriving, and `references/first-run.md` § "When the configuration does not arrive" in the `daily` skill is the route. The other cause is a task the hook could not write, which is the elevated-shell registration under "If it fails" below; the hook gives up on that one until the next release rather than retrying every session.
3. Fire one capture by hand and confirm the files land: run `screenshot_capture.py` from the sibling skill's `scripts/`, **passing the same directory as its first argument**, then list that directory's folder for today and confirm `HH-MM-SS_m1.png` files appeared, one per monitor. The script would fall back to the configured value on its own, but only if the session published it — pass it explicitly so a check that comes back empty means no capture rather than two folders. Multi-monitor machines write `_m1`, `_m2`, `_m3`; a laptop on its own writes only `_m1`.

**If it fails** — decide which of three it is before telling the user anything, because they lead to completely different asks:

- **`Access is denied` on registration** — a previous task was registered from an elevated shell, so the task file is owned by `BUILTIN\Administrators`. Do *not* just have them re-run setup elevated: that succeeds and re-creates the task with the same owner, so the next ordinary re-register fails identically and they are back here. Two steps — `Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName WorkScreenshots -Confirm:$false` from an **elevated** PowerShell, then the setup script from a **normal** one, which is what leaves the task owned by the user.
- **`No module named mss` / `No module named PIL`, or the task's `LastTaskResult` is `0x80070002`** — an interpreter problem, not a security one. The stored path is absolute, so a Python upgrade or reinstall breaks every trigger from that moment on. Re-run the setup script, or pin the interpreter with `-PythonExe <path>`.
- **The task registers, reports `Ready`, and no image ever appears** — this is the one that is usually endpoint security. Read `references/endpoint-security.md` before saying so to the user: it has to be evidenced before it is escalated.

### 6. The calendar is settled — on and readable, or off on purpose

The only optional step, and it is entered either way: *off* is an outcome to state, not a step to skip. A user who has never heard of the calendar gets one sentence and a choice; a user who turned it on gets the same live check the other five get, before the `daily` skill starts depending on it.

**Do** — run the `daily` skill's `scripts/calendar_day.py` for **today**, resolved as described above, **in the Bash tool** and for the same reason step 5's `--where` is read there: the configuration reaches Bash tool calls alone, so run through PowerShell this reports the calendar off on a machine that has it on.

```bash
python "<daily>/scripts/calendar_day.py" <today, YYYY-MM-DD>
```

That one command is the whole check, whatever the toggle says. **Do not read the toggle to find out first** — a command written to see whether a configured value is set writes its own answer into the transcript, which is the rule from "Before you start" and the family the 0.5.0 leak came from. This one answers by doing what the `daily` skill will do, which is the only answer that means anything: on a machine with new Outlook alone the toggle is on and the calendar still cannot be read.

**Verify** — the command's own answer, which is one of three. Every refusal you can get here exits 1 — only a malformed date exits 2 — so judge it by the `ERR` line and never by the exit code:

1. **A JSON day, exit 0** — the calendar is on and working. Report **how many events it holds and the first one's subject**, and nothing else out of it: that is enough to show the adapter reached the right calendar, and the rest of the day's meetings are the user's business rather than the transcript's. An empty `events` list passes too — say which it is, though, because "the calendar was read and today has nothing on it" and "the calendar could not be read" look identical if you don't.
2. **`ERR the calendar is off: TIMESHEET_OUTLOOK_CALENDAR is not set to true …`** — the ordinary state, and most installs. Offer it in one sentence: *the plugin can read your Outlook calendar, so a meeting you sat through without touching the keyboard is billed rather than lost as a break, and a meeting it cannot corroborate is put to you as a question instead of billed.* If they want it, the route is `/plugin configure billables` → **Read my Outlook calendar** — or, on the exported install, the `TIMESHEET_OUTLOOK_CALENDAR=true` line of the `.env` beside the sibling skill's `SKILL.md`, the same file "Before you start" routes a gap to. **Then run the same command again — and read the answer by the route they took**, because the two routes reach a running session differently. A `.env` is read by the script itself, so the re-check should now print the day, and a second `off` means the line is wrong: `true` is the one spelling of on. **The dialog will still say off, and that is expected rather than a failure** — declared configuration is published to a session when it *starts*, so a value set now reaches the next one. Say that, and say what closes it: start a new session and run this one command again before the first `/billables:daily`. Don't send them back to the dialog, and don't record step 6 as passed on the strength of the dialog having been filled in — a user who is not told this reads their first drafted day, sees no calendar in it, and concludes the feature does not work. If they don't want it, say the calendar stays off and move on: off is exactly today's behaviour and costs them nothing.
3. **`ERR the calendar stays off: …`, or an adapter failure whose reason names classic Outlook** — the toggle is on and this machine cannot read a calendar. Say so and say why: the shipped adapter drives **classic Outlook**'s object model, which new Outlook (the store app) does not have at all, and which macOS and Linux have no equivalent of. Then **have them turn the toggle back off**, and do not leave this as a note for later — an on-but-unreadable calendar is not a quiet no-op. The `daily` skill stops on a calendar it was told to read and could not, so every run from here would fail on this same line until the toggle goes off.

**If it fails** — the answers that are not about the calendar at all, and are the more likely ones:

- **The re-check still says off in a session that started *after* the dialog was filled in, or straight away on the `.env` route.** That is no longer the expected answer above; it is the same gap as a `MISSING` in "Before you start" — the message names the shell when the configuration cannot have reached the command at all — and `references/first-run.md` in the `daily` skill owns the diagnosis. Check the spelling first: `true`, and nothing else, is on.
- **An `ERR` naming the activity source.** Step 1 passing does not keep the server running, and the corroboration verdict is computed against the day's window events, so there is no calendar day to be had without it. That is step 1 to re-check, not the calendar.
- **An `ERROR:` naming `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE`.** The wrapper needs the zone to know which day it is reading. This is the configuration gap from "Before you start" surfacing here; the calendar is untested until it is filled in, so say that rather than reporting step 6 passed.
- **`No such file`, or a `ModuleNotFoundError`.** The sibling path, not the calendar: `daily` on a plugin install and `billables-daily` in the shared export, per "Finding the files this skill needs".
- **`ERR the calendar adapter … is not there: this copy of the skill does not ship it`.** The wrapper is present and the adapter beside it is not, which is a half-copied install rather than anything the user configured. Re-install rather than re-configure — and until it is fixed the toggle has to go off, for the reason in outcome 3.

## When endpoint security is the answer

`references/endpoint-security.md` holds two things: how to establish that a step was actually blocked rather than merely broken, and the exact allow-list requests to hand over once it has been. Read it at the point a step fails in a way that looks like a block — never earlier, and never instead of the checks above.

## Done

Setup is finished when steps 1 to 6 have each passed their own check on this machine, and the three required configuration values are present. Step 6 passes on a calendar that was read *and* on a calendar deliberately left off; it is unfinished only where the toggle is on and the read failed. If any of the three came back `MISSING` at the start, re-run **the same probe from "Before you start"** — not a new one written for the occasion, which is where the value-printing version came from the first time.

Say so plainly, and say what is now true: the activity source is recording, titles carry client codes, the rules classify them, and screenshots are being captured on a schedule. **Where step 6 left the calendar on, say that too** — the calendar is read as a fourth source, so a meeting sat through without touching the keyboard is drafted as a block rather than lost as a break, and one the activity source cannot corroborate is put as a question at review rather than billed. It is the one thing here whose result is invisible until a day is drafted, so a user not told about it meets it as a surprise in their first timesheet. Leave the sentence out where the calendar is off. Then hand over the two things that are not this skill's:

- The `daily` skill has its own first run — it scaffolds the workspace and walks the user through the `Timesheets/.context.md` that carries their clients, colleagues and billing conventions. **Hand over the profile-to-code list from step 3 in writing, and say where it goes: `Timesheets/.context.md`, one entry per client alongside that client's other signals.** It is the same information, re-deriving it is waste, and a list that exists only in this conversation is a list that does not survive the session. Tell the user to invoke that skill next, for a day they have already worked.
- Two things go stale on their own and are worth naming now: a new client needs both a profile tag and a matching category rule, and a screenshot task that stops firing does so silently. `Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName WorkScreenshots` with a `LastTaskResult` of `0` is the health check.

Nothing in this skill posts to a timesheet provider, and the `daily` skill will not either without passing the confirmation gate. Say that too — it is the question a new user has and does not always ask.

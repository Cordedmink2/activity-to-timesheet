# CONTEXT.md

The vocabulary this project uses. Three services are in play today: ActivityWatch records what
happened on the machine, Dataverse holds the work items the machine was busy with, Harvest holds
the billed time. A fourth, the user's calendar, is opt-in and records what they were scheduled to be
doing. All of them are meant to be swappable, and the terms below are how the rules talk about
them — so that a second provider is an adapter rather than a rewrite.

**Only the provider is written to; everything else is read**, and that is the distinction the
boundaries are drawn on. A mistake at a read boundary yields an empty catalog. A mistake at the
write boundary bills a client wrongly — so credentials and the confirmation gate belong there and
nowhere else.

**What this asks for is precise, and it is not "delete the word Harvest".** A rule may name the
product where the product is the subject: "Post to Harvest", "no Harvest write without explicit
confirmation", the endpoint documentation. What a rule may not do is bake in one Harvest
*account's strings* — a task name, a project name, a client name — because those are one user's
facts and every user's differ. That is the line the glossary draws and
`tests/test_provider_neutrality.py` enforces.

The provider half of the abstraction is done to that line; the activity-source and work-item-source
halves are not, and this file says so below rather than pretending otherwise.

Use these words in issue titles, test names, skill instructions and reference documents. Where a
term below and a synonym both read fine, the term below wins; the synonyms are what drift looks
like.

Decisions that shaped this vocabulary are in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/) — ADR-0006 for why the
provider stays inside this plugin for now. The two boundaries the paragraph above draws are the
rule; [ADR-0007](./docs/adr/0007-two-boundaries-the-provider-writes-the-sources-read.md) is the
write-up of why they are drawn on direction rather than on service.

## The services

**Activity source** — the local service recording window titles, AFK state and browser tabs. Read
only. ActivityWatch today, reached at the configured `TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL`. Unlike the provider,
this one is *not* yet abstracted: the rules name ActivityWatch's buckets, its event schema and its
categories throughout, and `references/activitywatch.md` documents its API directly. The term
exists so that work has somewhere to start, not because it is done.

**Work-item source** — the system the user's work items live in, and the thing a **work-item
catalog** is pulled from. Read only, and it needs no credentials the way the provider does.
Dataverse today. Like the activity source and unlike the provider, this one is *not* yet abstracted:
one environment's entity names, columns and case-creation convention are shipped rather than
configured, which is the same "one user's facts" failure the provider boundary already fixed. It is
named here so the fix has a word to use.

**Calendar** — the user's schedule of meetings. Read only, opt-in, and absent unless configured.
Evidence of *intent*, not of activity: it says where the user was meant to be, and the activity
source says what the machine saw. That is why it is not an activity source, and the distinction is
load-bearing: a **calendar event** the activity source corroborates (a meeting window inside its
span) outranks one it does not, and an uncorroborated event is put to the user at review as a
**calendar question** rather than billed on the calendar's word alone. Outlook today, behind a narrow adapter, so a second
calendar is an adapter rather than a rewrite.

**Timesheet provider**, or just **provider** — the service that holds billed time and invoices
from it. The only one of the three that is *written* to, which is why the confirmation gate lives
against it. Harvest today, reached with the credentials in declared plugin configuration.
Everything the provider names — its projects, its tasks, its clients — is *its* vocabulary, not
this project's. Those strings reach a run from configuration or the user's workspace. They are
never a default in a shipped file, because one account's task list is one user's fact.

**Workspace** — the user's own directory (`TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE`), holding `Timesheets/.context.md`,
the cached catalogs under `.mcp/`, and any exports. The plugin holds no user data; the workspace
holds nothing generic.

## Reading a day

**Day skeleton** — the deterministic boundaries derived from AFK data: `work_start`, `work_end`,
breaks, active spans, and each span's `active_ratio`. Arithmetic, not judgement, and taken
verbatim.

**Signal** — an observable in the activity data that points at a client, and one that occurs
naturally in the work: a work-item number, an environment URL, an editor workspace, a repo path, a
meeting participant, a calendar event's subject or attendees. The user declares theirs per client in
`.context.md`, and a **category rule** is compiled from them.

**Client code** — the short name the user picks for a client, two to twelve characters: `ACME`.
Theirs, not the provider's client name and not a project code.

**Profile tag** — the client code in brackets, `[ACME]`, injected into every window title by the
browser extension in one browser profile. Not a signal: nothing about the work puts it there, the
user configured it, and it says only which profile the window belonged to. It belongs on a profile
dedicated to a single client and nowhere else, and it is the lowest-ranked evidence a rule is
compiled from — a general profile carrying one absorbs every page whose own content names a
different client, because the first matching rule wins.

**Category rule** — the regex the activity source matches a window against to label it with a
client. Derived: the plugin compiles them from the signals in `.context.md` and writes them, and
nothing reads them back as authority. What a wrong one costs is a mislabelled span, seen at review —
which is why the activity source's *configuration* is written to while its data is only read
(ADR-0007).

**Work item** — the identifier the work is tracked under in the user's own **work-item source**: a
ticket, case, story or bug. The highest-confidence signal there is, and what an entry's note should
name.

**Switch point** — the instant inside a stretch where the client evidence changes. A real
boundary even when no break falls there.

## What gets billed

**Block** — a proposed span of the day with one attribution. Local, reviewable, not yet billed.
Blocks are what a run drafts and the user corrects.

**Entry** — a block that has been recorded with the provider. Billed. The distinction is
load-bearing: a block can be redrawn freely, an entry is out in the world and changing one is a
separate write the user has to approve again.

**Confirmation gate** — the `--confirm` flag every write to the provider requires. It is not a
field and not a promise in prose: the scripts refuse to write without it. The frontmatter field
that stops a model starting the skill unprompted is honoured by some harnesses and silently
dropped by others, so the gate lives in the invocation, where no harness can drop it.

**Preview** — what an unconfirmed write prints instead: the exact body it would have sent,
`WOULD POST <body>` or `WOULD PATCH <id> <body>`, then exit 0. A forgotten flag is therefore a
preview and not an error. A preview is not an entry — nothing reached the provider, and the block
it describes is still a block.

**Attribution** — what a block still needs: client, project, task, billable or not, and a
confidence rating.

**Client** — who the work is for.

**Project** — the provider's unit that a client's work bills to. Carries a **project code** where
the user's backend syncs one.

**Task** — the provider's sub-category of work within a project, and where the authoritative
`billable` flag lives. A task's *name* is the provider's string; a task's *meaning* is a work
kind.

**Work kind** — the neutral category of what a block was. The rules decide the work kind from the
evidence; the user's `.context.md` maps work kind → the task their provider actually offers.
Seven, and only these seven:

| Work kind | The block was |
|---|---|
| `Meeting` | a call or meeting |
| `Development` | writing or changing code, configuration, builds, deployments, bug fixes |
| `Documentation` | docs, wiki, proposal or statement-of-work writing |
| `Project management` | planning, backlog grooming, coordination |
| `Testing` | testing, QA, smoke tests |
| `Investigation` | sustained read-only analysis with no edits at all |
| `Internal admin` | the user's own overheads — timesheets, internal tooling, training |

**Assignment catalog** — the cached list of the projects the user may bill to and the tasks
assigned to each, pulled from the provider into `.mcp/`. The authority on which tasks exist and
which are billable.

**Exclusion** — a stretch deliberately not billed, declared as such rather than silently absent.

**Confidence** — `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `LOW`, the rating a block carries into review. `LOW` is
flagged 🔸 and asked about.

## How it reaches a machine

**Plugin install** — `/plugin install billables`, the Claude Code route. The manifest is what makes
it one: it declares the configuration, so the harness holds the credentials and there is no secrets
file for the skill to create.

**Export**, or the **shared Agent Skills export** in full — the copy `install/export_agent_skills.py`
generates into `~/.agents/skills/`, for the harnesses that read that directory instead. Generated in
one direction and never hand-edited, so it is an artifact, not a second source of truth. It has no
manifest and therefore no harness to hold credentials, which is why its settings live in a `.env` at
the exported skill's root. See ADR-0004.

The old word for the export was **copied-in install**, from when it was a file copy rather than
something generated. It named the mechanism, and the mechanism is what changed; "export" names the
thing.

## Words to avoid

Habits, not prohibitions — the rule above (no account's strings) is the hard one.

| Don't write | Write |
|---|---|
| "Harvest entry", "Harvest task", "Harvest project" | entry, task, project |
| "Harvest note" | the entry's note |
| "timesheet line", "time entry row" | entry |
| "time chunk", "segment", "slot" | block |
| "category" for what a block was | work kind (the activity source's own `category` keeps that name) |
| "tag" on its own for the bracketed marker | profile tag, and client code for the short name inside it |
| "ticket" as the general term | work item ("ticket" is fine where the user's work-item source calls it one) |
| "Dataverse catalog", "the case list" | work-item catalog (the work-item source's own listing) |
| "the user's backend", "the ticket system" | work-item source |
| "copied-in install", "the copied-in route" | the export (of the skill: an exported install) |
| "dry run", "test post", "--dry-run" | a preview (what the confirmation gate prints) |
| "appointment", "invite", "meeting" for the item on the calendar | calendar event (`Meeting` is the work kind a block ends up as) |
| "explicit confirmation", "the confirm flag" as the concept's name | the confirmation gate (`--confirm` is its spelling) |

So: naming Harvest is right where the subject genuinely *is* Harvest — the `harvest_*.py` scripts,
their credentials contract, the declared configuration keys, the endpoint documentation, and the
workflow steps that post to it. Reaching for one of its task names in a rule about how to read a
day is the drift this file exists to stop.

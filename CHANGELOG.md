# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- **The timezone is read from the machine when you have not set one** (#30). `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE`
  is no longer required: left blank, every script that reads a day takes this machine's own zone —
  the registry on Windows, `TZ`, `/etc/localtime` or `/etc/timezone` elsewhere — and labels the
  day `zone Pacific/Auckland, derived from this machine` in its header and its JSON `zone` field.
  The `daily` skill carries that label into the timesheet's Notes and repeats it in the Step 8
  confirmation, so a wrong zone is seen before anything is posted. A configured zone still wins
  and is not announced; `--utc-offset` still wins over both. There is still no fixed fallback: a
  machine whose zone cannot be read, or that names one this interpreter cannot load, gets the same
  refusal as before, naming the setting — plus the line saying what the machine reported and that
  `tzdata` is what makes it load. The `setup` skill's configuration probe no longer reports a
  blank timezone as `MISSING`, and the `reconcile` skill no longer treats one as a gap. Nothing
  to do on upgrade: a zone you set stays set and keeps winning.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-10

### Upgrading
- **A profile tag now belongs only on a browser profile you use for one client** (#72). If you
  tagged a general or default profile — the one you use for everything, which is what the previous
  walkthrough told you to do — clear its title format back to `{title}-{hostname}{path}{args}{hash}`
  in the URL-in-Title options. Nothing fails if you don't, and that is the problem: the first
  matching rule wins, so a general profile's tag claims every page in it, including the hour of
  Acme's work you did there because the tool was already open. `/billables:setup` walks the change
  and checks the general profile carries no code. `demo/tag-rule-demo.html` § 5 shows the hour
  moving.
- **Your existing category rules are untouched, and offered for adoption once.** The plugin writes
  the rules from here on, but it keeps every category it did not write, exactly as it is — `id` and
  all — and puts them below its own. The next `/billables:setup` run reads them, proposes which
  client and which signal each one is really matching, and asks once, as a single list you accept,
  correct or skip. Skip and they go on working as they always did — above the profile tags the
  plugin writes, so a rule of yours still wins a title it has real evidence for. An adopted rule
  keeps one copy even where its category is not named for the client alone, which the nested
  `Work > Acme` this README recommended for a long time is the ordinary case of.
- **Adding a client is now one edit in one file.** Signals go under that client in
  `Timesheets/.context.md`; the rules follow on the next `/billables:daily` run. A rule you edit by
  hand in the settings dialog for a client the plugin manages is discarded at the next rebuild, so
  edit the file rather than the dialog.

### Added
- **The plugin owns the ActivityWatch category rules** (#69). `scripts/category_rules.py` compiles
  them from the signals you declared, gates each one, orders them, backs the old set up and writes
  it, then reads them back and verifies. Setting this plugin up no longer asks you to type a regular
  expression into a settings dialog, and no run shows you one. The step it replaces was the one most
  likely to be wrong in a way nobody notices: a rule matching nothing leaves a client's whole day
  uncategorized, and a rule matching too much is worse than noise, because the timeline takes the
  *first* matching category as a span's label and an over-broad rule therefore takes the label off a
  correct one. On the maintainer's own machine a bare-word rule matched 256 of 552 browser titles in
  a single day.
- **The gate, which is the point of the split** (#71). A run composes the pattern for a signal —
  that is judgement, over a file that holds prose and hints, and no parser should be asked to do it
  — and the script judges what was composed, which is not. It refuses a pattern that does not
  compile, one that matches none of your recent window titles, and one that matches more than 35% of
  them (`--max-share`, and a `## Preferences` line in the workspace template). A refusal anywhere
  writes nothing at all: the rule set is written whole, and a bad rule in it would outrank a good
  one. A **scoped** signal is judged against the titles of the application it is scoped to, not the
  whole day: the ceiling was calibrated on 256 of 552 *browser* titles, and measuring that same rule
  against every Explorer and editor window the machine saw would let it through. Rule order is
  imposed by signal type rather than accepted — most specific first, and the fallback signals (a
  profile tag, a browser profile's name) written **below even the rules this plugin did not
  author**, so the more specific evidence wins a span two rules both match whoever wrote them. A
  signal type that never reaches a window title, a local repository path, is skipped with the reason
  said out loud rather than refused.
- **Rules become more specific rather than less.** Because the timeline matches a rule against the
  window's app name *and* its title, a rule can name the application it applies to — so a client's
  environment address is matched in a browser window and an editor workspace in an editor, and the
  client's name appearing in an unrelated page title attributes nothing. The script anchors that
  itself, on both the Windows and macOS spellings of each application, so a composed pattern never
  carries one. Editor time now carries a client label without a screenshot being opened.
- **The rules stay current on their own** (#74). They are a derived copy of `.context.md`, so the
  `daily` skill checks a stamp at the start of every run — two local file reads, nothing over the
  wire — and rebuilds when that file has moved under them. A change the skill proposed and you
  approved rebuilds inside that same approval rather than asking twice; a hand-edit you made last
  week is caught by the check. The managed set is regenerated whole, so a client you drop from that
  file loses its rule (reported as `DROPPED`) instead of going on labelling spans as something
  nobody declared. What was written is recorded only once the verify passes, so a write that did not
  land leaves the rules stale and the next run rebuilds them rather than trusting yesterday's
  record. A run whose context file has not changed writes nothing to the
  activity source, and a rebuild the gate refuses reports itself and does not stop the day being
  drafted: a category is a first-pass signal that Steps 4 and 5 check anyway.
- **A recovery path, and a way to see what is there.** The previous rule set is copied into
  `<workspace>/.mcp/` before the first write of a run — which is what makes the write safe to
  perform without asking you to read a diff — and `--inspect` reports every rule the activity source
  holds, marked managed or yours, with the share of your recent titles it matches and an example of
  what it caught — and marked `EDITED` where a rule this plugin wrote has been changed in the
  settings dialog since, which the staleness check cannot see because it reads no rules at all. A
  rule you damaged by hand is put back by recompiling; the set as it was before any write of this
  plugin's is the backup.

### Changed
- **`aw_client.py` gained a write path**, `post_setting()`, and it is the only thing this plugin
  writes to the activity source: configuration, never data (#70). ADR-0007 is amended for it — the
  boundary is drawn on *what a mistake costs* rather than on direction, which is the argument its
  own context section already made. A wrong category rule mislabels a span, is shown to you at
  review and cannot reach an invoice; the confirmation gate stays where the expensive mistake is.
  ADR-0005 is amended in place: four of its five manual steps are still manual, and this one is not.
- **The glossary distinguishes three things that were all called a tag** (#70): a **profile tag** is
  the bracketed marker the extension injects, a **client code** is the short name inside it, and a
  **signal** is client evidence the work itself produces. The distinction is what the ordering above
  is stated in.
- **`references/first-run.md`, the README's category section and the tag-rule demo** no longer
  describe a category rule as a bare client code (#75). The demo's first walkthrough is now framed
  as what the gate refuses, and a fifth shows an hour of a client's work being claimed by a general
  profile's tag and then correctly attributed once that tag is cleared.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- **The `setup` skill hands the user an instruction instead of a paragraph** (#65). Steps 1 to 4
  each carry a block-quoted block that is what to read out, with the command or URL on its own
  line — including where the URL-in-title options page actually is, which the skill asked for and
  never said, and the extension ID a managed browser needs, which until now only the reference
  carried. In those four steps the surrounding prose is the reasoning and is not read out; nothing
  about steps 5 and 6 changes, and step 6 still puts its own sentence to the user. No verify and no
  failure branch changed: what the user is asked for is now stated rather than inferred from the
  argument for it.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-09

### Upgrading
- **Changing an entry's times or its date now needs `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` too**, where
  `harvest_patch.py` previously needed nothing but credentials. It has to know when the clocks
  change to refuse a patch that would leave an entry running straight through one, and it asks for
  the zone the same way the create does — same message, naming `/plugin configure billables`, and
  before the preview rather than only before the write. A plugin install has already supplied it;
  what changes is patching on a machine configured for nothing else. A patch that cannot move a
  clock — notes, project, task, `--hours` — still asks for nothing.
- **A patch that changes a time or a date now reads the entry first**, one `GET` per invocation,
  because a patch carries only what it changes and the guard is on what the entry would end up as.
  Nothing about the body that goes out changes. It is not paid for on a patch that cannot straddle:
  notes-only and the like, a `--date` naming a day the clocks do not repeat on, or a patch that
  already names the date and both times. **It happens on the preview too** — a change that must not
  be applied must not be offered — so previewing a time or date change now needs credentials, a
  reachable Harvest and an entry id that exists, where before it needed none of them. A mistyped id
  answers `ERR 404` instead of printing `WOULD PATCH`.

### Added
- **A calendar toggle and the wrapper behind it** (#50, the first piece of #49). A new optional
  setting, **Read my Outlook calendar** (`TIMESHEET_OUTLOOK_CALENDAR`), off by default and mirrored
  as a blank line in the export's `.env.example`; a test now holds the template and the manifest
  to the same keys. The configuration seam learns its first boolean: `true` in any case is on,
  and blank or anything else is off. `scripts/calendar_day.py` is the wrapper the `daily` skill
  will read the calendar through — one day's events from whichever adapter is configured,
  filtered to what counts (accepted, organised or tentatively accepted; busy or tentative; timed;
  not cancelled; starting on the day in the configured zone), as JSON with clocks in the
  skeleton's notation. Off, it exits non-zero saying so; an adapter that cannot read the calendar
  is a non-zero exit carrying its reason, never a quiet empty day. **Nothing reads it yet**; the
  skill steps follow.
- **The Outlook adapter** (#51, the third piece of #49). `scripts/outlook_calendar.ps1` is the
  adapter the toggle names: on a Windows machine with classic Outlook, it reads the **default
  calendar only** through Outlook's COM object model — shared and delegate calendars are never
  looked at — expands recurring meetings into the day's instances, and prints the raw day in
  the wrapper's contract with basic fields only: subject, start, end, show-as, response, all-day,
  cancelled and attendee names, meeting rooms dropped. An appointment the user wrote themselves
  is reported as `organizer`, so the site visit with no invitation still counts. Outlook is
  started in the background if it is not running and is never closed. Instants are printed in
  UTC and the day is read a day wide either side, so the machine's zone and the configured
  `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` need never agree. No classic Outlook — new Outlook alone, or none — is a
  non-zero exit with one line naming the cause, which the wrapper carries to the user; so is
  anything Outlook reports outside the enumerations the contract spells, rather than a guess.
  Parses under Windows PowerShell 5.1 and is held to it by the same test as the other scripts.
- **The corroboration verdict** (#52, the second piece of #49). Every event the calendar wrapper
  prints now says whether the activity source backs it: `corroborated` is true when a meeting
  window — a `Meeting | …` or `Call with …` title, the same pattern the daily skill already
  treats as a meeting's start — intersects the event's span. A corroborated event carries the
  `evidence` span seen and a proposed `block` span: the event, extended to the end of the
  evidence when the meeting ran over, and never past it on the AFK watcher's word alone. An
  uncorroborated event carries neither, whether the user was at the machine doing something else
  or on a client site before it opened. Meeting windows are read as the timeline reads them —
  heartbeats collapsed, sub-five-second flashes dropped, fragments under a minute apart joined —
  and the two noise constants now live in the shared activity client so both readers hold one
  copy. The wrapper reads the day's window events from ActivityWatch before it runs the adapter
  and refuses, in the two day-reading scripts' words, when it cannot: a day with nothing to
  corroborate against is not a day on which no meeting was attended. The verdict is computed
  once, here; the steps that read it are still to come.
- **The `daily` skill reads the calendar, and drafts the meeting the AFK watcher lost** (#53, the
  fourth piece of #49). Step 2 now runs `scripts/calendar_day.py` beside the skeleton and the
  timeline. On the great majority of installs it exits saying the calendar is off, and that is a
  state rather than a failure — the day is read from the three sources exactly as before; any
  other non-zero exit stops the run and is reported as it stands, because a calendar the user
  turned *on* and did not get is a missing source. Step 3 then drafts a **corroborated** event as
  one block over the wrapper's `block` span, **even where the skeleton recorded a break inside
  it**: the forty-five minute meeting spent listening, camera off, keyboard untouched, is one
  billed block instead of twenty-five minutes of break. Nothing about the skeleton moves — the
  break is still a break and the AFK watcher still settles active and idle, the calendar no more
  than a screenshot does — so the break the block swallowed is declared under the table beside
  the known exclusions, naming the event that covers it. The Step 6 guards gain exactly one named
  exception between them: verbatim outer edges now has two (the shrunk thin block, and this), and
  the `work_end` ceiling defers to it where the meeting's own `block` span runs later. A block that
  starts before `work_start`, or ends past `work_end` with the evidence stopping earlier, is
  flagged for the user rather than billed or trimmed — there the calendar and the skeleton
  genuinely disagree. An
  **uncorroborated** event is never drafted and never billed — a meeting skipped and a meeting
  taken from the car look identical from here — the next entry is what becomes of those.
- **The meetings the machine cannot see are put to the user as questions** (#54, the fifth piece
  of #49). Every **uncorroborated** calendar event is now listed under the proposed timesheet as a
  **calendar question** — subject, time and attendees, one line each — and the review question
  counts them beside the block counts, so the client site visit before the laptop opened takes one
  word to bill instead of being remembered. None of them is in the table, in the block counts or
  in the coverage check until it is answered, and **batch-accept does not cover them**: a yes meant
  for the drafted blocks can never bill a meeting on the calendar's word alone. A yes makes it a
  block over the event's span, classified like any other, declared under the table with the answer
  as its evidence and recorded with the day's entries — it may sit outside the AFK watcher's active
  time entirely, across a break or after the day's last keystroke, because what settles it is the
  user rather than the machine, and the three hard guards leave a block the user dictated alone. It
  replaces what it covers rather than doubling it, so a call accepted inside a stretch already
  drafted splits that stretch instead of billing over it. A no leaves the event unbilled and is
  recorded with the day, so that date does not ask twice; an unanswered one is offered again.
- **Setup settles the calendar, and every optional setting says where to learn what it does**
  (#56, the sixth piece of #49). `/billables:setup` gains a sixth step, entered on every run —
  *off* is an outcome it states rather than a step it skips. It runs `scripts/calendar_day.py` for
  today in the Bash tool instead of reading the toggle: a command written to find out whether a
  setting is set writes its own answer into the transcript, and it answers the wrong question
  anyway, since on a machine with new Outlook alone the toggle is on and the calendar still cannot
  be read. Three outcomes, told apart by the `ERR` line because every refusal exits 1 — a day
  read, reported as its event count and the first subject and nothing else out of it; the calendar
  off, which is most installs, where the feature is offered in one sentence, routed to the
  configure dialog or the export's `.env`, and then re-checked — with the two routes read
  differently, because a `.env` is read by the script and a dialog reaches a session at its start,
  so on the plugin route the re-check saying *off* is the expected answer and the step finishes in
  the next session; or a toggle that is on with no classic Outlook behind it, where the user is
  told why and asked to turn it back off, because the `daily` skill stops on that same line every
  run until they do. The finish names the calendar among what is now true when it is on. And every
  **optional** setting now ends its description with the same sentence — *Not sure? Leave it as it
  is and run /billables:setup.*, and the export's `.env.example` with its own — including the
  workspace one, rewritten in both places to say what the folder holds in words that mean
  something before anything has run: a `Timesheets/` folder with one file per day reviewed, and a
  hidden copy of your projects and tasks. It used to say ".mcp/ catalogs" to a reader who has seen
  neither.

### Changed
- **The maintainer's record and guide left the shipped skill.** `skills/daily/TESTING.md` is now
  `docs/skills/daily/decision-log.md` and `references/self-development.md` is `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  so the export carries only what a run reads; `references/setup.md` is `references/first-run.md`,
  which stops it sharing a name with the `setup` skill; the root `INTENT.md` fragment is retired in
  favour of `intent/foundational/intent.md`; ADR-0007 exists as a draft; `AGENTS.md` now routes a
  finding, a change and a decision to the file that holds it.
- The zone a day is read in, and every clock conversion that follows from it, now live in
  `scripts/timezone.py` (#36). Both halves of the skill need that arithmetic and neither owns it:
  the two write scripts had been importing the ActivityWatch client to reach it, and one of them
  had been importing the other for the daylight-saving refusal. Nothing about a command line, an
  output shape or a message changes — the functions moved as they stood. What is different is that
  no script that posts to Harvest imports anything of the activity source's, which is the edge
  ADR-0006 said had to be gone before the provider moves behind a command contract.
- The confirmation gate, the preview and the `OK` / `ERR` contract are one implementation,
  `scripts/harvest_write.py`, which `harvest_post.py` and `harvest_patch.py` both declare their
  body to. No command line changes. One message does: a patch with `--start` after `--end` now
  explains why it is refused, the way the create already did, instead of stating only that it is.

### Fixed
- **A patch could move an entry's times across a daylight-saving change and bill it short,
  silently** (#32). Harvest recomputes the duration from the two clock times on a `PATCH` exactly
  as it does on a create, so the entry `harvest_post.py` has refused since 0.6.0 could still be
  reached by patching a correct one: `harvest_patch.py <id> --start 01:30 --end 04:15` on
  `2026-04-05` in `Pacific/Auckland` left 2.75 hrs where 3.75 were worked. The check is on the
  *resulting* entry, so `--start` alone, `--end` alone and `--date` alone — which moves the date
  under times nobody typed — each reach it, and the refusal is the create's own message, with both
  replacement ranges and why they are not the overlap they look like. `--hours` on its own is not
  refused — a duration-mode account has no other way to correct such an entry — but passed
  alongside times it settles nothing, because Harvest recomputes hours from them, so that
  combination is refused like any other. On a start/end-time account, which is the usual one, the
  fix is the two entries the message names: patch the one you have to the first and post the
  second. A malformed `--date` is now an `ERR` naming the format instead of Harvest's 422.
- **The screenshot task survives a plugin update** (#29). It stores an absolute path to the capture
  script, and on a plugin install that path names the *versioned* cache folder — so every
  `/plugin update` left it running the superseded release's script (the old folder stays on disk,
  `LastTaskResult` stays `0`, and nothing looks wrong) or, had the folder gone, failing `0x80070002`
  on every trigger. The session-start hook now compares the stored path with the version that is
  starting and rewrites that one path when they differ; start time, end time, interval, days,
  capture directory, interpreter and principal are left exactly as registered. Nothing to do on
  update. The read costs about 60 ms per session start through `schtasks`; the write, about once a
  release, one PowerShell start — and a write that is refused (a task registered from an elevated
  shell) is remembered and not retried until the next release. A hand-installed or exported copy's
  task is not touched — that, and the refused case, are still `/billables:setup`'s read-back check.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-03

### Upgrading
- **Install at *user* scope, and if the plugin is already installed, check which scope you got.**
  `claude plugin list` prints it, alongside whether the plugin is enabled in the directory you are
  standing in. A **local**-scope install is bound to the one folder it was installed from: start a
  session anywhere else and the plugin is disabled there, no session-start hook runs, and none of
  your configured values are published to any shell — the credentials you filled in are stored
  correctly and simply never arrive. `claude plugin enable billables@activity-to-timesheet --scope
  user` moves an existing install without re-entering anything. `/plugin install` from inside Claude
  Code can land either scope depending on the prompt you answer; the `claude plugin install` command
  line defaults to user.
- **If you installed by hand, you are not on this release and re-running the installer will not
  put you on it.** The old path copied the skill to `~\.claude\skills\daily-timesheet`; the
  installer now generates the shared Agent Skills export instead and leaves that folder alone —
  still loading, still answering, frozen at whatever version you copied. The export itself says so
  when it finds one.

  README § *Updating* → *"Coming from a hand-installed copy"* is the route across: install the
  plugin, move the `.env` values into `/plugin configure billables`, re-register the screenshot
  task with `/billables:setup` (it points at a script inside the folder you are about to delete),
  then delete the folder. Your workspace, your timesheets and your `.context.md` are outside it and
  are not touched.

  One setting changes shape rather than moving. `--utc-offset 12` becomes a timezone asked for as
  an IANA name, so daylight saving is derived per date rather than being a number you edit twice a
  year. There is no conversion from the old number and no default: it decides where your day starts
  and ends, and a guess mis-dates a timesheet without anything appearing to fail.
- **Posting a time entry now needs `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` too, where it previously needed nothing.**
  `harvest_post.py` has to know when the clocks change to refuse an entry that runs through one, so
  it asks for the zone the same way the two reading scripts do — with the same message, naming
  `/plugin configure billables`, and before the preview rather than only before the post. A plugin
  install has already supplied it and nothing changes. What changes is running that one script on
  its own on a machine configured for nothing else: it now stops with that message instead of
  posting. It carries no `--utc-offset`, so the setting is the only way in.

### Added
- **A `reconcile` skill that asks one question of a month: which days were worked but never
  billed, or billed short — and what was happening on them.** The answer is a worklist, not a
  report. Each row names a date, what the evidence says was going on, and the next action; you
  bill it by running `/billables:daily <date>` as usual. Nothing in the sweep records time.

  The shape is what keeps it cheap. Two reads find the month's gaps — one listing of what is
  already billed, one listing of the folder names under your screenshot directory, which is the
  index of days the machine was used at all — and the days that are already billed drop out
  before anything is investigated. What is left is usually two to five days rather than
  twenty-two, and each one is handed to its own small subagent: independent, so a messy day
  neither slows the others down nor contaminates them, and mechanical enough that a cheap model
  does it well. Each reports the day skeleton and the raw client signals it found, never a
  billing verdict.

  Two things it refuses to guess. A day with no captures and no billed time is a day with no
  evidence, so it is reported as that rather than as idleness — and a run of capture-less days
  from one date onward is a capture task that stopped firing, which is one maintenance finding
  and not a month of gaps. Where the evidence runs out, the row is a question for you.
- **`harvest_list.py --by-day`**, one row per date instead of one per entry — total, entry count
  and project codes, with a row for every date in the range including the ones holding nothing.
  A day with no entries is *absent* from the per-entry listing, so reading gaps off that listing
  means reasoning about what was never printed. It is what the month sweep runs, and it is also
  the cheapest way to see a fortnight's gaps at the start of an ordinary day's run.
- **A `setup` skill that walks you through the parts of the install only a person can do, and
  checks each one.** Installing the activity source, adding the browser extension, tagging each
  browser profile with a client code, building the category rules that read those tags, and getting
  the screenshot task past whatever your employer runs on the endpoint. Five steps, and after each
  one a check that has to come back before the next starts.

  The checking is the point. This part of the install fails silently in a way the rest of the plugin
  does not: an extension added to the profile you weren't browsing in, a category rule whose brackets
  don't match your tag, a scheduled task registered against an interpreter that has since moved. All
  three look exactly like success, and the symptom arrives days later as a day with nothing in it. So
  the extension is proved by finding a hostname in a real window title, the tags by finding each code
  you named in a real title, the rules by compiling each one and running it against those titles, and
  the capture task by firing one by hand and watching the files land — plus reading the registered
  action back, which is what catches a task still pointing at an older hand-installed copy.

  When a step really is blocked, the ask is a specific one: the task name, the resolved script and
  interpreter paths read off your own machine, the browser extension's ID for an
  `ExtensionInstallAllowlist`, index access for `mss` and `Pillow`. And it has to be evidenced first —
  a quarantine entry, a denied registration, a proxy error you actually read. The first coworker
  install of this pipeline sent its user to IT for an allow-list when the fault was a split Python
  install that needed no ticket at all.

  It collects nothing. The credentials, the timezone and the paths are already declared configuration,
  so a missing one is routed to `/plugin configure billables` rather than asked for again — a token
  typed into the conversation is a token written to disk in the transcript. Your workspace and the
  `.context.md` describing your own clients stay with the `daily` skill's first run, which this hands
  over to once it has told you setup is finished.
- **The skills are generated into the shared Agent Skills directory, so harnesses that aren't Claude
  Code get them too.** `install/export_agent_skills.py` writes `skills/` out to `~/.agents/skills/`
  — where Codex, OpenCode, Hermes and the other Agent Skills clients look — one prefixed directory
  per skill: `billables-daily`, with its declared `name:` rewritten to match, because that directory
  is flat and unnamespaced and a bare `daily` among your own skills is both anonymous and a
  collision. The export is an artifact and not a second source of truth: it is generated from the
  plugin in one direction, running it twice leaves the tree byte-identical, and whatever has left the
  plugin leaves your copy too — a file, or a whole skill that was renamed or retired and would
  otherwise keep answering alongside the live one. Your `.env` is the one thing kept across a
  regeneration, since an exported install has no harness to hold credentials.
  `docs/adr/0004-…` records the reasoning.

  Retiring a skill deletes, so it takes proof rather than a guess: each exported directory carries
  a stamp, and only a stamped one is ever removed. A skill of your own named `billables-something`
  is left exactly where it is — the shared directory is flat, the prefix is where this export
  *looks*, and being in the neighbourhood is not evidence that it wrote the thing.

  `install/install_skill.ps1` and `install_skill.sh` now do this and nothing else — they find an
  interpreter and hand over. They used to copy the skill into `~/.claude/skills/daily`, and that is
  the copy that is going away: if you installed that way, the plugin (`/plugin install`) or this
  export replaces it, and the old folder should be deleted once your `.env` has moved across. The
  export won't delete it for you — it may be holding the credentials you filled in — but every run
  that finds one now names the path and says so.

  Two smaller pieces come with it. `SKILL.md` declares a `compatibility:` line — the interpreter, the
  activity source, the credentials and the Windows-only screenshot capture — because a harness with
  no plugin manifest to read has only the frontmatter to learn that from. And workspace resolution
  now knows `.agents/`, so a skill installed at `<workspace>/.agents/skills/billables-daily` resolves
  the workspace around it exactly as the `.claude/` shape already did.

### Changed
- **The rules decide a work kind; your workspace names the task.** The classification rubric used to
  map a block's activity straight onto the literal task names of one Harvest account —
  `Gen - Development/Configuration`, `Gen - Meeting`, and the rest — and `SKILL.md` shipped one of
  them as a default. No other account names its tasks that way, so those strings were one user's
  facts shipped as everybody's. The rubric now stops at one of seven neutral **work kinds**
  (`Meeting`, `Development`, `Documentation`, `Project management`, `Testing`, `Investigation`,
  `Internal admin`), and a new "Work kinds" table in `references/context.md.example` is where your
  provider's own task names live. There is no default task name anywhere in the shipped skill: a run
  with no mapping asks, because a guessed task name is not a task your provider has. The vocabulary
  behind this is written down in `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root, `docs/adr/0002-…` records why the
  provider adapter stays inside this plugin for now, and `tests/test_provider_neutrality.py` fails if
  a provider's task name comes back or if the seven kinds drift apart across the three documents
  that spell them.

  **Two things do decide differently, and neither could be avoided while removing the names.**
  Internal-admin blocks used to name one account's `No Display` task and now take your
  `.context.md` default task for internal/admin time — a different task on an existing install, so
  check where that time lands on your first run. And the two named last-resort fallbacks are gone:
  where the task you'd pick isn't assigned to a project, the skill now matches the work kind
  against that project's *actual* task names instead of reaching for a fixed one. Everything else
  is wording. The golden days are byte-identical, but say what that is worth: they measure the
  day skeleton, not task selection, so they prove no script changed — not that classification
  didn't. The two changes above are what reading the diff finds.
- **The confirmation gate is part of the invocation.** `harvest_post.py` and `harvest_patch.py` now
  write only when passed `--confirm`; without it they print the exact body they would have sent and
  exit 0, having created or changed nothing. The gate was previously an instruction only, backed by
  the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter field — which Claude Code honours and several other
  Agent Skills harnesses silently drop. Where the field is ignored, the flag is what stops a model
  that was never asked to bill from writing to a client-facing timesheet. A run that forgets the flag
  gets a preview, which is a useful answer rather than an error, and the previewed body is the
  request body itself so it cannot drift from what a confirmed run sends. The existing guards still
  run first: a reversed range is an error, not a preview.

### Removed
- **The old install path is gone: `llms.txt`, the `VERSION` file and the release ritual.** There
  were two ways in — the two `/plugin` commands, and a 225-line runbook you pasted a prompt about
  and an agent followed. Two install paths drift, which is the failure this whole effort exists to
  remove: through 0.4.4 the runbook stated flatly that ActivityWatch was not on
  winget, which it is. Installing is now the two commands and then `/billables:setup`, which covers
  the same manual ground with a check after every step. `docs/adr/0005-…` records the reasoning.

  The README keeps its prose walkthrough — someone judging the tool before installing anything
  needs to be able to read what it will ask of them — marked as the reading version of what the
  skill runs rather than a second procedure.

  Nothing is lost for a user with no marketplace access: `install/install_skill.{sh,ps1}` generates
  the shared Agent Skills export from a clone, and the `setup` skill is in it — README step 5 now
  names all three exported directories rather than only `billables-daily`, because a capability
  nobody is told about is not one they have.

  Four things the runbook carried alone moved rather than went. The `setup` skill gained the
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 checks (`pwsh` may not exist; a bare `~` is not expanded for a native
  command) and the split-install tell, both of which bite at the one step it calls the most likely
  to be silently blocked. `references/setup.md` gained the workspace scaffold — the three
  directories and the `.context.md` seed, with a route for a user who has no clone to run the
  script from — and the advice to leave the Work kinds table until credentials exist so the task
  names can be read off the user's own account. README step 9 now says where the two Dataverse
  values go on a plugin install: ordinary environment variables, not a `.env` inside the plugin
  folder that the next update overwrites.

- **The version lives only in the plugin manifest.** `skills/daily/VERSION` recorded it a second
  time, and nothing bumped the two together. `export_agent_skills.py` already read the manifest to
  print the version it exports, so there was nothing to replace; `tests/test_distribution.py` holds
  the manifest against the changelog heading, and that pair is the whole release. On a shared export
  there is now no version marker at all — the issue form asks for the plugin's version instead
  (`/plugin` in Claude Code, or the `Exporting billables v...` line the export prints).

  The publish script and the three-copy ritual it drove went with it, along with the instructions
  that described them.

### Fixed
- **"Credentials not found" on a correctly configured machine now names the cause it used to leave
  out: the plugin is not enabled in the directory you started the session in.** The message offered
  two explanations, a stale session and a missing Git Bash, and neither was true of the run that
  produced it — so it sent you off to re-enter credentials that were stored perfectly well. A
  **local**-scope install is enabled only in the folder it was installed from; elsewhere no
  session-start hook runs and nothing is published to Bash *or* PowerShell, which looks exactly like
  never having configured anything. The error now lists that cause with `claude plugin list` to
  check it against, and it is listed on every platform, because it has nothing to do with which
  shell you are in. § *Upgrading* above has the one-line move to user scope.
- **A `python3` that exits without publishing anything no longer stops the hook from trying
  `python`.** The wrapper tried three interpreter names in turn and took a zero exit as success,
  but on Windows `python3` is frequently an install-manager shim: it returns 0 having run nothing,
  so the loop stopped at the first name and the session started with no configuration and a hook
  that reported success. Each candidate is now judged on whether the published fragment actually
  *grew*, measured as a delta because that file is shared with every other hook, so a shim is
  skipped and the working interpreter behind it gets its turn.
- **A configured plugin that looks unconfigured now says why, and the skills read in the shell the
  values arrive in.** The declared values are published as a POSIX shell fragment, and Claude Code
  applies that to its **Bash** tool alone — so a script run through PowerShell reported the timezone
  or the credentials missing on a machine set up perfectly well, and the message sent you to start a
  new session or install Git Bash. Neither was the fix, and following either cost you the run. The
  skills now read every configured value in Bash and hand PowerShell the resolved literal; where a
  command gets through anyway, the error says the configuration did not reach it, that a new session
  will not help, and to re-run through the Bash tool.

  A script you invoke through PowerShell yourself still will not see the configuration — that is the
  harness's scope and not something this plugin can widen. `/plugin configure billables` needs no
  re-running and Git Bash needs no re-installing; that remains the fix for the *other* gap, a machine
  with no Git Bash at all, where the publishing hook cannot start and nothing reaches either shell.
- **The month sweep could list an empty folder on a machine that captures perfectly well.** The
  screenshot directory was read in PowerShell, where a configured `TIMESHEET_SCREENSHOTS_DIR` is
  always empty, so the index fell back to `~\Pictures\WorkScreenshots` — and a healthy month looked
  like a month nobody worked. Both skills now resolve it with `screenshot_capture.py --where`, which
  applies the same precedence the capture task writes by. Two related fixes ride along: a `~` in that
  setting is now expanded rather than taken as a directory literally named `~`, and the setup skill
  quotes the path it passes to the scheduled task, so a capture directory with a space in it
  registers instead of erroring.
- **The second-pass marker is refused inside the hour the clocks *skip*, where it used to be accepted
  and read an hour early.** On a spring-forward morning `02:30*` resolved an hour *before* unmarked
  `02:30`, so `--window 02:15*-02:45*` was accepted and silently reported on 01:15–01:45, and
  `--window 02:15*-02:45` returned ninety minutes from a thirty-minute clock range. The marker names
  a second pass over a *repeated* hour, so inside a skipped one it names nothing and now says so by
  name. An unmarked reading in that hour is unchanged: it still resolves to the instant a clock left
  running would next have shown.
- **A one-ended marker on a fall-back day is no longer reported as the hour the clocks skip.**
  `--window 02:30*-02:45` on `2026-04-05` — and `02:00*-02:30`, which is the shape
  `references/output-format.md` leads a reader to write — was refused as spanning a spring-forward
  that does not happen on that date, sending them hunting a transition six months away. The cause is
  the unmarked *end*, which resolves to the first pass an hour before the marked start, and that is
  what the message now says: mark both ends or neither.

  Both came of reading `fold` as a boolean. A repeated hour and a skipped one shift the offset in
  opposite directions, so telling them apart needs the sign of the shift and not merely that there is
  one — `datetime.time` comparisons ignore `fold` entirely, which is how the two cases were crossed.
  That distinction now lives in one function both callers route through.
- **`--confirm` can be typed anywhere on a patch, and a field flag left without its value can no
  longer swallow it.** `harvest_post.py` accepted the flag before or after its positional arguments;
  `harvest_patch.py` read the entry id off the first argument, so the same habit —
  `harvest_patch.py --confirm 12345 --notes 'x'` — failed with `Unknown flag: 12345`, naming the one
  argument that was right. Worse, `--notes --confirm` took the gate as the note's text and previewed
  it as though you had meant it; appending the flag, exactly as the preview's own last line tells you
  to, then wrote `--confirm` to your timesheet as the note. The flag is now removed before anything
  is read positionally, so a forgotten value is an honest `Missing value for --notes` instead.
- **The day the clocks change is read at its real length.** The configured `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` was
  reduced to one offset per day, read at local noon, and applied to every instant in it. On a
  transition day that is wrong at both ends at once: `2026-04-05` in `Pacific/Auckland` is
  twenty-five hours long, so ActivityWatch was asked for the day an hour late and never handed back
  the first hour of work, while everything before the change rendered an hour early — a session that
  started at 00:40 reported starting at 23:40 the night before. Neither failure raised anything; the
  day just read short. Each instant is now converted at the offset in force for it, so a
  twenty-five-hour autumn day and a twenty-three-hour spring one are both bounded correctly. A span
  crossing the change is reported at its elapsed length, which is an hour longer than its two clock
  times look.
- **The hour the clocks go back no longer prints two instants as one time.** On a fall-back day the
  local clock repeats an hour, and both passes rendered `02:30:00`: an hour-long break across the
  change came out as `02:30:00-02:30:00`, two active spans an hour apart abutted, and the timeline's
  web rows — sorted on the rendered string — put that hour's browsing in the wrong order. The second
  pass is now suffixed `*` (`02:30:00*`), and `--window` / `--cover` read the suffix back, so a block
  lifted out of one script's output names the same instant when handed to another. Unmarked still
  means the first pass, and no other time on any other day changed. Web rows sort on the instant.
  A marker on a time the clock reads only once (`09:00*`, or `03:00*` that same morning) is refused
  by name rather than quietly ignored. Before it reaches Harvest the marker must be stripped, and an
  entry must not span the change — `references/output-format.md` §Conventions has the split, which is
  not where it looks: the transition instant is `02:00*`, and `03:00` is an hour after it.
- **A create that runs straight through the autumn change is refused instead of billed an hour
  short.** Harvest derives an entry's duration from its two clock times, so `01:30` to `04:15` on
  `2026-04-05` in `Pacific/Auckland` posted as 2.75 hrs against the 3.75 hrs really worked — and
  nothing raised, because the entry is well-formed and reads correctly in every listing afterwards.
  `harvest_post.py` now names the two entries to post instead, `01:30`–`03:00` and `02:00`–`04:15`,
  and says why they are not the overlap they look like: the clocks go back at one instant, which
  reads `03:00` as you reach it and `02:00` once it has passed, so the first ends where the second
  begins. Closing that apparent overlap is what loses the hour.

  It refuses rather than splitting: two entries out of one approval would put a body on the wire
  nobody previewed. Only the entry that contains the whole repeated span is refused — one that
  merely starts or ends inside it bills correctly for whichever pass it was, and the guidance for
  those stays in `references/output-format.md`. The span is read from the zone rather than assumed
  to be an hour, so `Australia/Lord_Howe`'s thirty minutes split at thirty minutes. A date with no
  transition is untouched, and an entry across a *spring*-forward is out of scope for now.
- Headers name the zone (`zone Pacific/Auckland`) when one is configured, rather than printing a
  single offset that a transition day does not have. A run passing `--utc-offset` still reads
  `offset UTC+13`, which is what was typed.
- **`--utc-offset 99` is refused with a message** instead of raising out of the zone constructor.
- **The copied-in installer's `.env.example` lists `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE`.** A plugin install is asked
  for the key at setup, but a copied-in one only ever learns of a setting from this template — and it
  still described the 0.4 surface. Someone who filled in the two Harvest keys and ran the skill hit
  "refuses to date a day" on their first attempt, over a required setting the file never mentioned.
  `TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL` is listed alongside the other optional settings for the same reason.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **The plugin declares its configuration surface, and a fresh install asks for it once.**
  `HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID`, `HARVEST_API_KEY` and `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE` are required;
  `TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL`, `TIMESHEET_SCREENSHOTS_DIR` and `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE` are optional and
  skipped. `/plugin configure billables` changes them later. The two Harvest fields are declared
  sensitive, so Claude Code stores them in its own credential store instead of a file inside the
  plugin — the OS keychain on macOS, `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on Windows and Linux. Nothing for
  this skill to git-ignore, and a plugin update cannot carry them off. A SessionStart hook publishes
  the values into the session so the bundled scripts resolve them through the existing seam; no new
  precedence and no second reader.
- **The judgement tunables are settable without editing a script.** `afk_blocks.py` gains `--solid`,
  `--blip-gap`, `--min-uncovered`, `--active-band` and `--thin-band`; `activity_timeline.py` gains
  `--noise-floor` and `--gap-fold`. Each shipped constant is now that flag's default, so an existing
  run is unchanged. They belong to how a person works, so they are documented in the workspace's
  `## Preferences` — which names the flag for each — rather than in a shipped file an update
  overwrites.
- **`TIMESHEET_ACTIVITY_URL`** points the scripts at an ActivityWatch running somewhere other than
  `http://localhost:5600`.

### Changed
- **`--utc-offset` no longer defaults to 12.** Both scripts resolved the day's boundaries at UTC+12
  when no offset was passed, so every user outside New Zealand got a day boundary up to twelve hours
  out — and nothing failed: events landed on the wrong date and the only symptom was a day that
  looked oddly short. The offset now comes from the configured `TIMESHEET_TIMEZONE`, read at the
  date being analysed; a run with neither that nor `--utc-offset` stops and says which value it
  needs. `--utc-offset` still overrides for a single run. The `.context.md` template no longer seeds
  a New Zealand timezone into a new user's workspace.
- **The "credentials not found" message leads with `/plugin configure`**, keeping the `.env` route
  for the copied-in install that has no harness to ask.

### Upgrading
- **Delete any `.env` inside an installed plugin.** The two routes now carry the *same* six keys,
  and the seam puts `.env` above the process environment where the configured values arrive — so a
  leftover file silently outranks `/plugin configure`. The tell is a rotated token that still 401s,
  or a timezone change with no effect. `references/setup.md` § "When the configuration does not
  arrive" covers it, along with the other cause: on Windows the session hook that publishes the
  configuration runs under Git Bash, and cannot start without it (`winget install Git.Git`).
- **The repo is now a plugin marketplace holding one plugin, `billables`.** `/plugin marketplace
  add Cordedmink2/activity-to-timesheet` then `/plugin install billables@activity-to-timesheet`
  installs it; the skill is invoked as `/billables:daily`. The repo is renamed
  `activity-to-timesheet` — the old name still resolves through GitHub's rename redirect.
- **The skill moved from `skill/daily-timesheet/` to `skills/daily/` and is declared as `daily`.**
  The manual install scripts still work and now copy to `~/.claude/skills/daily`; they print a note
  if an older `daily-timesheet` folder is still installed, because two copies of one skill means
  either can answer.
- **`SKILL.md` no longer hardcodes a path into a Claude-specific skills directory.** The `scripts/`
  prefix is resolved from the directory `SKILL.md` was read from, so the bundled scripts are
  findable wherever the skill is installed. A test now fails on any instruction that writes one down.

### Fixed
- **Workspace auto-detection is anchored on the install shape instead of a depth.** It walked two
  arbitrary ancestors and took the first that looked workspace-shaped, so an install nested one
  level deeper than expected resolved to whatever real workspace happened to be above it — silently:
  the refresh reported success and the stale catalogs surfaced days later. It now requires the skill
  to sit directly inside a `skills/` directory, and never treats a plugin's own root as a workspace.
  **Consequence for plugin installs:** the skill is not inside a workspace, so nothing is
  auto-detected and `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE` has to be set. Refusing is the point — the alternative is
  guessing — and the install now asks for it, as a declared optional option.

## [0.4.11] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
- **A day the user has already ruled on is no longer re-litigated.** Step 1's already-covered
  branch named `Timesheets/<date>_harvest_responses.json` as "a free done-marker", which invites
  an agent to test that the file exists and never open it. It now says to read it whole — the
  schema is ad hoc, so there is no key to look under — and states that a ruling the user gave on a
  window binds: recomputing an `active_ratio` or re-reading a screenshot is the same argument on
  the same data, not new evidence.
- **A proposed *reduction* now pulls in `references/classification-rules.md`.** The branch skips
  the rubric deliberately to avoid redrafting, which is right while verifying and wrong the moment
  it starts subtracting — the guards against over-reading a thin block (supervised agents, meetings
  invisible to the window watcher, browser rows spanning hours) all live there.
- **Screenshot guidance widened.** The folder mechanics licensed checking the other monitors only
  "when hunting a client signal", which still permitted a single-monitor read to answer "is
  anything happening at all". A capture showing wallpaper, a lock screen or a black screen is now
  stated to be evidence about that monitor and nothing else; the AFK watcher owns active/idle.
- Frontmatter `description` shortened to match `disable-model-invocation: true`.

### Added
- **Byte size as screenshot triage.** A black or locked capture is ~6-7 KB, so `Length` ranks a
  long index before spending image tokens on it — with both observed limits: a large file can be a
  detailed wallpaper photo, and constant sizes are a fact about a screensaver, not about the user.
- `references/self-development.md` gains two rows in the multi-copy drift table: "screenshots never
  settle active/idle" and "check the other monitors before trusting one".

### Notes on the evidence
Both changes are rung 1 — an observed production failure, recorded in `TESTING.md`. A prior
session's audit proposed deleting one entry and trimming another on activity-ratio and
single-monitor screenshot evidence; both entries existed because the user had explicitly asked for
them a week earlier, and the response file said in terms that the ratio does not govern them.
Reading a second monitor at the same timestamps refuted both. Caught at the confirmation gate,
nothing was deleted. **The fixes themselves are untested** — the post-fix fresh-agent arms were not
run, so the rung-1 evidence establishes the failure, not the repair.

Also carries reference-file work from earlier sessions that had not been published: the long
browser row rule in `classification-rules.md`, and two observed defects in `new-client-work.md`
(`head`/`grep` buffering the Dataverse device-code prompt into an apparent hang; `--ponumber`
doubling the work-item reference in a client-facing project name).

## [0.4.10] - 2026-08-19

### Upgrading

Re-run the installer; no config or task changes. If you installed this skill rather than
maintaining it, the new `references/reporting-issues.md` is how a run now routes a defect back
here.

### Added
- **A way to report a defect upstream.** Step 11 gains a third destination: a script returning a
  wrong answer, a guard that didn't fire, or an instruction wrong for every user goes to
  `references/reporting-issues.md` when the user installed the skill, and to
  `references/self-development.md` when they maintain it. The reference carries the repository
  URL, what must be redacted first, and the confirmation gate.
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/skill-defect.yml`** — an issue form for anyone arriving at the repo,
  with a required redaction acknowledgement. Plus a "Reporting a problem" section in the README,
  which previously said nothing about issues at all.

### Notes on the evidence
Three fresh agents were given a genuine uncovered script defect and an installed-skill scenario.
All three proposed reporting it upstream unprompted, so no rule tells them to; all three refused
to file it under any circumstances, so the rule *permits* filing behind an explicit yes rather
than restraining it; all three went looking in `self-development.md` for the route, so that file
now points at the right one; and **none of the three mentioned redaction** while drafting a public
issue off a client timesheet run, which is what the new reference mostly exists to fix.

Re-run against this release, same fixture: redaction 0/3 → **3/3**, repo URL without asking 1/3 →
**3/3**, and 3/3 now ask for a yes to *filing* as distinct from agreeing the defect is real.

A fourth destination for "the machine, not a document" was drafted and dropped: the same test
showed agents already route `uncategorized` categories to `references/setup.md` unaided.
`TESTING.md` has both runs, including a first measurement discarded for a leading question in its
own prompt.

`gh issue create` ships **unexercised** — GitHub was unreachable from the release machine.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-08-19

### Upgrading

Re-run the installer; no config or task changes.

### Fixed
- **Verifying an already-billed date never checked what the entries were billed *to*.** Step 1's
  already-covered branch asked for `--cover` plus the `<0.4` idle band, and both are time
  questions — an entry with the right clock and the wrong project passes `--cover` perfectly. In
  a three-agent test against 0.4.8, two agents verified a day containing a known mis-booked entry
  and reported it holds; both stated they had skipped the screenshots and the rubric because the
  branch did not ask for them. The branch now requires reading one screenshot inside every
  non-billable or internal entry, and `classification-rules.md` scopes its timesheet-admin
  screenshot check to verifying an existing entry as well as booking a new one. Re-run after the
  fix: 3/3 caught it.
- **An exclusivity claim in the Step 8 checklist** ("this is the only one that would catch a
  duplicate day") — the shape `references/self-development.md` forbids, committed in the same
  change as the rule forbidding it. Reworded to state what the line does rather than what no
  other line does.

### Changed
- **Step 12 no longer cites its own test results.** The rep count behind the today-in-progress
  bullet moved to `TESTING.md`, which owns test records.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-08-19

### Upgrading

Re-run the installer; no config or task changes. Two behaviour changes worth knowing:
the skill now checks Harvest before rebuilding a date you named, and it reads the whole
of `Timesheets/.context.md` on every run rather than whatever part it thought it needed.

### Fixed
- **A dated run never checked whether the date was already billed.** Given "do yesterday"
  the workflow went straight to rebuilding the day from ActivityWatch. Steps 3, 6 and 8 all
  validate the proposal against ActivityWatch and none against Harvest, so a duplicate day
  passed every guard and double-billed the client — `--cover` reports clean, because the
  blocks are correct, just already posted. Step 1 now checks Harvest (and
  `Timesheets/<date>_harvest_responses.json`) before loading anything, with a restatement in
  the pre-post checklist. Found independently by all three agents in a live three-rep test.
- **Timesheet-admin time was being back-billed onto real client work.** The timesheet run
  happens after the last block it can bill, so it lands on the previous one — observed as a
  24-minute block posted as non-billable admin while every screenshot across it showed
  client work. The rubric now requires confirming a timesheet surface is actually on screen
  before booking timesheet-admin time.
- **Step 12 was ambiguous about today-in-progress**, and three test agents split three ways
  on it. Today-so-far now explicitly counts as a next date. The instruction to re-invoke the
  skill after `/clear` was prose and survived only one run in three; it is now a bullet.

### Changed
- **`Timesheets/.context.md` must be read whole, every run** — never grepped, sliced or
  skimmed. Its facts are cross-cutting, so a partial read yields confident wrong answers
  instead of an obvious gap. This is what the size budget is for, so a file over budget gets
  trimmed rather than partially read.
- **`afk_blocks.py --window` is a focused report.** It keeps the header and the
  `work_end`/blip/tail warnings and drops the breaks and active-spans lists, so validating
  four thin stretches no longer costs four whole-day dumps. `--cover` and `--json` unchanged.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-08-19

### Upgrading

Docs only — no script, config or task changes. `git pull` then re-run the installer.

### Fixed
- **`SKILL.md`'s "Files in this skill" list had drifted.** It omitted `scripts/aw_client.py`
  — a runtime import of both `afk_blocks.py` and `activity_timeline.py`, and already listed
  in the README's directory tree — plus `VERSION`, `tests/` and `pytest.ini`. Nothing catches
  this: the installers and mirrors copy whole trees, so a missing entry never stops a file
  shipping, it just leaves the reader with a wrong map.
- **An exclusivity claim in `references/classification-rules.md`.** "This table is the single
  authoritative mapping — `SKILL.md` does not carry its own copy" is the shape the skill's own
  maintainer rules ban, because it enforces a snapshot and rots silently while still reading
  as authoritative. Reworded to name the owner instead.
- Two rationales that cited a multi-day run in one session, which Step 12 now rules out.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-08-19

### Upgrading

Skill instructions only — no script, config or task changes. `git pull` then re-run
`install\install_skill.ps1`; the `WorkScreenshots` task is unaffected. Behaviour change
worth knowing before your next run: the skill now finishes one date and stops, and asks
you to `/clear` before the next one rather than working through a backfill in a single
session.

### Added
- **Step 12 — one date per session, then reset.** After the date is done (posted or
  explicitly not, wrapped up, and every `.context.md` proposal written or declined), the
  skill asks for a `/clear` before starting the next date, and re-invocation with it since
  `/clear` unloads a non-model-invocable skill. `/compact` is the named fallback if you'd
  rather keep the thread; declining both is honoured. Nothing is said when you're all
  caught up.

### Changed
- **Step 1 takes the oldest gap day instead of asking which to do.** With one date per
  session the choice no longer arises, so the "ask when several prior gap days compete"
  clause is gone; the full gap list is still reported on a no-date run.
- **Step 10 no longer names the next date.** It reports whether days are outstanding and
  leaves the next date to Step 12, so the reset ask comes before the next day is opened.
- `references/self-development.md` registers the new rule's three copies in its
  duplication table.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-08-19

### Upgrading

Docs and demo only — no skill-script, config or task changes. `git pull` then re-run
`install\install_skill.ps1`; the `WorkScreenshots` task is unaffected.

### Added
- `demo/tag-rule-demo.html` — a self-contained interactive demo of the tag/category-rule
  failure modes (mismatched formats, bare codes claiming incidental prose, spaces inside
  alternations), linked from README step 4 and offered by the setup runbook. All sample
  clients and URLs are fictional (ACME, BETA, Ledger, Nimbus).

### Fixed
- **ActivityWatch *is* on winget** — `winget install ActivityWatch.ActivityWatch` pulls the same
  official installer as the download page, and it was the faster route on the install that prompted
  the 0.4.4 docs. `llms.txt` had it flatly backwards ("not on winget — the direct download is the
  only route"); both it and README step 1 now lead with winget on Windows.
- **`llms.txt` handed the agent commands that fail on a stock Windows box.** Steps 8 and 10 used
  `~/…` paths, which Windows PowerShell 5.1 passes to a native command literally (only PowerShell 7
  expands them), and `python`, which is usually the Store stub the same file warns about two
  sections earlier. They now use `py "$HOME/…"`, and environment detection says to check `pwsh`
  exists before using it.
- The demo's second walkthrough claimed a bare `ACME` rule wasn't in the emailed-contract title and
  needed broadening to `Contract|ACME` to cross-claim it. It was: the rule already matched
  `acmetrust.sharepoint…` in the URL. The step now shows that directly, with no rule edit.

### Changed
- README: step 8's credential check now uses `py` and documents the
  `(no time entries …)` success notice; the repo map gained `demo/` and the
  previously-missing `tests/`.
- The prerequisite Python check is `py -m pip --version` — reaching pip is the one check that rules
  out both the 0-byte Store stub and a split install (which prints a version quite happily).
- `llms.txt`'s AV/EDR rule now says to prove a block — a log line, a quarantine entry, a denied
  registration — before sending the user to IT. The install that produced these notes raised an
  allow-list request for what turned out to be a split Python install needing no ticket.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-08-19

### Upgrading

No config or task changes: `git pull` then re-run `install\install_skill.ps1` (the
registered `WorkScreenshots` task keeps working — the interpreter probing applies the
next time the setup script runs). If your clone carries local edits to
`setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1` or `tests/test_install_scripts.py` from a pre-0.4.4
session hotfix, discard them first (`git checkout -- .`) — this release supersedes them.

### Fixed
- **`setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1` took the first interpreter that existed, and both
  failure modes on a coworker's first install were interpreters that existed.** The
  Windows Store app-execution alias is a 0-byte `python.exe` that runs nothing, and a
  split install (executables separated from `Lib\`) imports the stdlib through a registry
  `PythonPath` while `sys.prefix` — and with it pip and site-packages — resolves to
  garbage. Either one, selected on existence, registers a task that never captures a
  single screenshot. Every candidate is now probed with a real import (via
  `Start-Process`, because `&` doesn't wait on the GUI-subsystem `pythonw` and leaves
  `$LASTEXITCODE` stale), 0-byte stubs are rejected on size, and the split-install
  warning on stderr fails the probe even on exit 0. A new `-PythonExe` parameter pins the
  interpreter explicitly; a broken `-PythonExe` is an error, never a silent fallback.
- **A test could register a real scheduled task.** The PS 5.1 parameter-binding test
  stripped `PATH` and relied on the "Python not found" guard as its early exit; with the
  interpreter now resolved by probing (system launcher included), that guard is no longer
  guaranteed to fire. The test runs under `-DryRun` with a cleanup fixture, so it can
  never register anything regardless of what the resolver finds.

### Changed
- `harvest_list.py` prints `(no time entries from … to …)` to stderr when the range is
  empty. Success-with-no-entries and a run that silently did nothing were previously
  identical on stdout, and the setup runbook's credential check reads exactly this case.
- Setup docs (`llms.txt`, README, `references/setup.md`) carry the lessons from that
  first coworker install: probe Python rather than trusting names on PATH; ActivityWatch
  is not on winget; the URL-in-Title tag format and the AW category regex must agree
  (and get verified against real events, not the UI); the Dataverse `pac` profile must be
  *named* (`pac auth create --name …`, or `pac auth name --index <N>` to fix an unnamed
  one); Harvest tokens are better pasted into `.env` than into the chat, which is saved
  to disk in plaintext.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **`afk_blocks.py` could not see a break the AFK watcher never recorded.** The watcher
  writes nothing at all while the machine sleeps or is locked, so a long absence leaves a
  *hole* in the event stream rather than an `afk` event. `find_breaks()` filtered on
  recorded `afk` spans and `active_spans()` split only on one, so neither ever measured
  the elapsed time between consecutive events: a hole was invisible to the first and
  merged straight across by the second. On a real day carrying a three-hour morning gap
  and a 47-minute lunch, the skeleton reported `breaks: (none)` and a single unbroken
  12-hour active span — asserting the absence of breaks rather than merely missing them,
  which matters because the skill is told to take that list verbatim. Holes of at least
  the break threshold are now materialised as explicit spans, so they both list as breaks
  and split the surrounding active span.

### Changed
- Breaks in `afk_blocks.py --json` carry a `kind` of `afk` or `gap`, and gap breaks are
  tagged in the text output. A watcher outage is absence of evidence; a recorded `afk`
  span is evidence the user was at their desk and idle. Conflating the two is what allowed
  an empty breaks list to be read as proof the user was never away.
- `classification-rules.md` §5 is now **Environment identifier** rather than "URL
  pattern". Admin tools that connect to a client environment — XrmToolBox, database and
  API clients, RDP sessions, CLI auth profiles — carry a fixed product name in the title
  and show the environment only on screen. The connected environment decides the client;
  the tool name never does, and neither does the workspace behind it. §6's adjacency rule
  explicitly does not extend to them, since connecting to a different environment is
  frequently the switch point itself.
- `TESTING.md` records three findings from 2026-08-18: the data-hole defect above, the
  environment-connected-tools signal, and the replacement of a hand-written prefix →
  client list with a derivation from the Harvest catalogs (a per-user `.context.md`
  change, recorded here because the reasoning belongs with the test record).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **`harvest_lookup.py` could not find a project by its client's name.** It matched
  `project.code` and `project.name` only, so a project named for the *work* it covers —
  carrying the client's name solely on `client.name` — was invisible to a search for that
  client. Where the client also had an old presales or shell project named after them, the
  lookup returned that shell as the only hit, and its all-non-billable task set is easy to
  accept as the answer. Matching now includes `client.name`, in both the catalog path and
  the time-entries fallback, with results ranked exact-code → code/name → client-only and
  each match reporting `matched_on` plus the client. The human-readable listing shows the
  client alongside the project name.

### Changed
- `SKILL.md` documents client name as a first-class search term for `harvest_lookup.py`,
  and warns that the top hit is not automatically the right project — read every candidate,
  and treat an all-non-billable task set as the tell for a shell project.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-14

Documentation and test-suite corrections found by reading the four `test_edge_*.py`
modules line by line. No script behaviour changed.

### Fixed
- **Three test docstrings described defects 0.4.0 had already fixed** — a `harvest_patch`
  guard documented as absent while the test's own assertion proved it fires, and two
  claims that `harvest_client.request()` reads an error body without closing it. The
  `ResourceWarning` suppression that accompanied them is replaced by a positive no-leak
  test mirroring the ActivityWatch-side one, so a re-introduced leak fails the run instead
  of being ignored. A stale docstring passes every run; only reading catches this class.
- **`harvest_list`'s missing-metadata test covered one of four shapes.** Its `parametrize`
  carried a single case, and it asserted on a count of `?` across the whole line, which
  cannot tell a missing project code from a missing task name. The project and task
  fallbacks are independent, so each is now exercised alone and asserted per column.

### Changed
- `TESTING.md` records the `SKILL_ROOT` location-dependency bug found during the 0.4.0
  release — a test whose result depended on which checkout it ran from, which the suite
  structurally could not catch and the release mirror did.
- The timeline rollup's first-match-wins attribution for ambiguous spans is now pinned by
  a named test in both class orderings, and recorded as considered-and-kept. An event
  matching two clients credits all of its minutes to whichever rule ActivityWatch ordered
  first; `!MULTI` on the span is the compensating control.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **A test harness for the scripts.** `tests/support.py` builds a whole day from local
  `HH:MM` strings and serves it from a real HTTP server, so a fixture reads as the day it
  describes rather than as a list of UTC events. `tests/scenarios.py` holds seven such
  days — locked screen, blip-and-tail, interleaved clients, no break, overnight, idle, and
  a UTC+13 daylight-saving day — each pinned by both a golden file and named assertions.
  Goldens catch *change*; named assertions state *intent*; a golden on its own will
  happily bake in a bug. `--regen-golden` rewrites them, `--bench` runs the benchmarks
  (skipped by default). The skill's suite went from 92 tests to 261.
- `tests/README.md` — how to write a day, and why `.locked()` and `.thin()` exist.
- `references/self-development.md` ships for the first time; it was previously live-only.

### Fixed
Seventeen script defects, each reproduced red before being fixed. `TESTING.md`
§ "Script defects" carries the full record with an evidence rung per entry. The ones that
produced a *silently wrong answer* rather than a crash:

- **A dead window watcher read as an empty day.** `activity_timeline.py` printed a
  timeline with no rows and exited 0 — indistinguishable from a day with no activity. It
  now fails when the window bucket is missing.
- **Overlapping `--cover` blocks reported over 100% coverage.** The blocks were summed
  without being unioned first, so the Step 6 floor check passed on overlapping input.
- **Zoom dropped the browser tab that was open when the zoom started** — the row most
  likely to name the client, filtered out for having started before the window.
- **`--json` did not always emit JSON.** A no-activity day printed prose to stdout.
- **`harvest_patch` last-won on a repeated flag** and sent the request anyway. It now
  refuses.
- **The live lookup fallback was not scoped to the caller**, so an admin-scope token
  paginated the whole company's entries and could surface a project the user has no
  assignment to — which then fails, or mis-bills, at post time.
- **`refresh_catalogs.py` deleted the old catalog before writing the new one**, so a
  failed write left no catalog at all and every later lookup fell through to the live API
  without saying so. Pages are now staged and swapped into place.
- **Workspace auto-detection could never work on a stock install.** It walked up two
  levels from the skill root — one short of Claude Code's
  `<workspace>/.claude/skills/<name>` layout — while `.env.example` promised it would.

### Changed
- **The suite is now hermetic.** One test shelled out with `subprocess`, which inherits no
  fixtures: it read the real `.env` and paged 180 days of live Harvest history. That was
  roughly 90% of the old suite's runtime, and a red build whenever Harvest was slow. An
  autouse fixture now points both API clients at an unroutable address and blanks every
  credential source, so a test that reaches for the network fails fast instead of touching
  a real timesheet.
- `TESTING.md` — adds the script-defect record, the code-review round, and two open gaps.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **Step 6 guard 1 could force idle time onto a client invoice.** On a day with
  no breaks, `afk_blocks.py` returns a single span covering the whole day. Guard 1
  required interior sub-blocks to "tile the span exactly", which left a stretch
  excluded under Step 3's `<0.4` band with nowhere to go — while the span-level
  ratio passed `>=0.7` by averaging the dead time away. Guard 1 now states that
  tiling governs adjacent *billed* sub-blocks, and defers to guard 3: an excluded
  stretch is declared under the table, not tiled over.

  Measured both directions on a fixture whose correct answer is 6.5 hr. Control
  (guard 1 as written), 4 reps: **8.21 / 8.21 / 6.52 / 6.52** — half of them
  over-billing by 1.7 hr, with two reps reasoning from the same span ratio to
  opposite conclusions. Treatment, 4 reps: **6.51 / 6.51 / 6.51 / 6.51**.
  Every treatment rep still declared the excluded time and put a question to the
  user, so the fix does not trade over-billing for under-billing.

### Changed
- `TESTING.md` — records the run above, and **amends the 0.2.9 entry**, whose
  "6/6" result overstated its evidence: that fixture pre-supplied the ratios that
  flag the anomaly. On a fixture without them, 0 of 4 reps reached
  `references/activitywatch.md`. The pointer stays out because this release removes
  the billing consequence, but the routing claim is reopened rather than settled.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-08-12

### Changed
- `TESTING.md` — records the first measured two-arm fresh-agent test in this
  skill, and the change it **rejected**. The worry was that `SKILL.md` routes
  `references/activitywatch.md` only as a raw-API reference, while its
  lock-screen fragmentation note matters during ordinary Step 3 blocking with
  ActivityWatch up. Six reps across a control arm and a treatment arm carrying
  an extra Step 3 pointer produced identical output, and all six named
  `references/activitywatch.md` unprompted with the correct expectation of its
  contents, working from the reference index alone. The pointer was not added.
  Two new open gaps are recorded from the same run, both with the fixture flaw
  that prevents them being settled yet written into their entries.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-08-12

### Added
- `classification-rules.md` — **Interleaved days step 7: some days have no
  switch point to find.** Two workspaces with an agent session in each, focus
  alternating every 1–3 minutes for hours, is genuinely parallel work: the
  existing procedure hunts a boundary that does not exist and burns screenshots
  doing it. Step 7 says to stop hunting, ask as step 4 already requires, and —
  only when the user hands the split back — allocate proportionally from a
  per-window tally, placing each boundary where that client's corroborating
  evidence clusters. The resulting boundary must be presented as an allocation
  rather than an observed switch.

### Changed
- `activitywatch.md` — the lock-screen note now covers the consequence that
  bites: a lock fragments the AFK record into chunks that each fall under the
  break threshold, so `afk_blocks.py` reports `breaks: (none)` for a day that
  plainly had them. Such stretches surface as sub-0.4 `active_ratio` windows
  with a matching gap in the captures, and are excluded under the `<0.4` band
  rather than by inventing a break the script never reported.
- `classification-rules.md` — "Focused window ≠ active attention" gained the
  mirror-image case on the AFK side: a low `active_ratio` while an agent runs
  is supervision, not absence, and supervised agent time is billable. Check the
  other monitors for the agent's output before shrinking a thin block or
  dropping a stretch on ratio alone.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- `setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1` baked the resolved absolute interpreter path
  into the scheduled task. A Python upgrade, reinstall, or move between
  per-machine and per-user install left the task pointing at a path that no
  longer exists, and every trigger from that moment failed `0x80070002` —
  silently, with the task still reporting `Ready`. Observed in the wild: a
  full afternoon of captures lost with no error surfaced. Setup now prefers
  the version-independent launcher (`pyw.exe`).
- The same script's dependency check ran through a bare `python.exe`, which on
  Windows is usually the Store app-execution stub. The Pillow/mss imports then
  failed on every run, so setup reinstalled both packages each time and exited
  non-zero. It now resolves through the launcher (`py.exe`).

### Added
- `TESTING.md` — the improvement record for this skill: test method, why rules
  are worded as they are, and options already tried and rejected. Read before
  editing `SKILL.md`; ignored on a normal run. Keeps settled decisions and
  negative results out of the operating instructions.
- `references/setup.md` gained a **Health check — captures stopped** section:
  a dead capture task fails silently, so it documents the
  `LastTaskResult` probe and reads `0x80070002` as "interpreter path moved".

### Changed
- `SKILL.md` Step 3 now compares the last screenshot's timestamp against
  `work_end` while indexing. A short capture folder looks identical whether the
  user stopped working or the grabber died; `work_end` separates them. Blocks
  after a capture failure are flagged as having no screenshot fallback, so they
  reach the user rather than being resolved on thinner evidence than the
  operator realises.
- `SKILL.md` no longer treats `python` in its own commands as a literal. It
  names the Windows Store-stub signature (help text plus exit code 49) as a
  missing interpreter rather than a broken script, and sends the machine's
  answer to `.context.md`.
- `SKILL.md`'s `--cover` guard said "billed entries", which read as excluding
  non-billable ones and invited passing an *excluded* stretch to the check —
  the one input that makes the guard report clean while under-billing goes
  unnoticed. Both copies (Step 6 guard, Step 8 checklist) now say "every entry
  Step 9 will post, non-billable included".
- `SKILL.md` Step 8 gained a skeleton-freshness check for days billed while
  still in progress, or sessions that cross midnight: `work_end` advances and
  late spans appear, moving both the last block's end and the coverage
  denominator.

### Upgrading
- **Re-run `pwsh -File scripts/setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1`** after updating.
  The `WorkScreenshots` task stores its command line at registration and is not
  re-registered by a skill update, so an existing install keeps the old,
  breakable interpreter path until setup runs again.
- Check an existing install first with
  `Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName WorkScreenshots`: a `LastTaskResult` of
  `0x80070002` means captures are already silently dead.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- `SKILL.md`'s Step 8 confirmation example showed a trailing-`S` ticket
  (`BET2020S`) without the `[Support]` tag its own documented rule requires —
  the example now matches the rule.
- `SKILL.md`'s screenshot-delegation guidance pointed to a procedure
  "above" that wasn't in that file; now cites
  `classification-rules.md`'s "Interleaved days" section directly.
- `references/activitywatch.md` and `references/setup.md` described bucket
  selection as picking by `last_updated` alone, omitting that a suffixed
  bucket is always preferred over an unsuffixed one regardless of recency —
  both now state the full two-part rule.
- `scripts/aw_client.py`'s `pick_bucket()` docstring shortened and corrected
  to match the two-part rule above.

### Changed
- `references/classification-rules.md`: merged two adjacent paragraphs that
  ended on the same remedy, and genericized an example hostname
  (`HOST-OLD`/`HOST-NEW`) so it no longer names this user's real machine in
  a doc meant to be shareable across users.
- `SKILL.md`: removed a duplicated sentence about the AFK-settled rule.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- `aw_client.py`'s `pick_bucket()` picked the alphabetically-first hostname-suffixed
  bucket, which silently kept reading a dead old-host bucket after a machine rename or
  reimage — the new host's suffix can sort after the old one. Now breaks ties by
  `last_updated` among suffixed candidates (an unsuffixed leftover still always loses),
  so a renamed/reimaged machine's buckets resolve correctly with no config change.

### Added
- `references/setup.md`: an "After a machine reimage or replacement" checklist covering
  the four things a reimage breaks at once — the screenshot scheduled task's Python path
  and packages, a stale `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE` in `.env`, missing `pac auth` profiles, and
  the AW hostname suffix.
- `references/classification-rules.md`: a rule to verify a `*.md` window title actually
  lives in the client's repo (`git log --follow` / find) before trusting it as content —
  a Claude Code skill's own reference doc can be open in any workspace and looks like
  client documentation otherwise.

### Changed
- `references/activitywatch.md` notes that bucket discovery breaks ties by
  `last_updated`, not alphabetically, and drops the stale example hostname.
- `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter description shortened, and `disable-model-invocation: true`
  added — the skill now runs only on explicit `/daily-timesheet` invocation rather than
  the model deciding to trigger it.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- `scripts/aw_client.py`: the ActivityWatch request, bucket-discovery, heartbeat-dedupe
  and timestamp helpers `afk_blocks.py` and `activity_timeline.py` each carried their own
  copy of. Both now import them, so a fix lands in one place instead of one script
  silently keeping the old behaviour.
- `setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1 -DryRun`: builds and prints the scheduled task it would
  register — command line, weekday schedule, repetition, capture directory — then stops
  without installing packages or registering anything. The capture directory is still
  created, so a dry run also tells you whether `-ScreenshotsDir` is usable.

### Changed
- `activity_timeline.py` reads the bucket list once per run instead of once per watcher
  it looks for (four requests down to one).
- The screenshot-setup tests now assert against a real task definition rather than
  pattern-matching the script's source, so argument quoting is covered too.

### Upgrading
Re-copy the skill. The two ActivityWatch scripts now need `aw_client.py` beside them, so
running them from a half-updated `scripts/` folder fails on the import.

    pwsh -File install\install_skill.ps1

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- `setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1 -ScreenshotsDir` created the directory you asked for and then
  registered a task that ignored it: `screenshot_capture.py` always wrote to
  `~/Pictures/WorkScreenshots`. The directory is now passed to the capture script, which takes
  it as its first argument, else `TIMESHEET_SCREENSHOTS_DIR` from `.env` (resolved through the
  same helper as every other setting), else the default.
- `references/catalog-refresh.md` and `references/new-client-work.md` wrote the Dataverse case
  helpers as `python scripts/create_incident.py`. `SKILL.md` defines that shape as relative to
  the skill folder, but those two scripts live in the user's workspace, so the documented
  command resolved to a path that doesn't exist. Both are now written as explicit
  `<workspace>/scripts/…` paths.
- Both installers copied `.pytest_cache/` into the installed skill.

### Added
- `skill/daily-timesheet/VERSION`, reported by both installers and checked against this
  changelog by the test suite, so an installed copy can be identified.
- `.gitattributes`. Windows sets `core.autocrlf=true` by default, so a fresh clone rewrote
  `install/*.sh` with CRLF endings and `bash` failed on the shebang's trailing `\r`. Shell
  scripts now check out LF everywhere.
- Unit tests for `afk_blocks.py`, covering work bounds, the end-of-day blip guard, break
  detection, active-span folding and the coverage check.

### Changed
- `afk_blocks.py`'s day arithmetic moved out of `main()` into `to_spans`, `work_bounds`,
  `find_breaks`, `active_spans`, `active_seconds` and `uncovered_segments`. Same output; the
  logic is now reachable without a running ActivityWatch.

### Upgrading
Re-copy the skill:

    pwsh -File install\install_skill.ps1

If you passed `-ScreenshotsDir` before, re-run `setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1` with it — the
existing scheduled task still has the old argument-free command line.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- `setup_screenshot_pipeline.ps1` could not run under Windows PowerShell 5.1 at all: it used the
  pwsh-7-only `?.` and `??` operators (a parse error on 5.1), and built its `-CaptureScript`
  default from `$PSScriptRoot`, which 5.1 leaves empty while binding parameters. Both defaults
  now resolve in the body, spelled out with `if`/`else`.
- `setup_workspace.ps1` failed to parse under Windows PowerShell 5.1. The file was UTF-8 without
  a BOM, so 5.1 read its em dashes as mojibake and lost a string terminator. All three `.ps1`
  files are now ASCII with a UTF-8 BOM.
- `install_skill.sh` deleted the user's `.env` when re-run on a machine without `rsync`: the
  fallback path cleared the whole destination directory first. It now copies in place and keeps
  any existing `.env`, matching what the README documents and what the PowerShell installer does.

### Changed
- The `rsync` path in `install_skill.sh` no longer passes `--delete`, so both copy paths refresh
  files in place rather than mirroring — the behaviour the README describes.
- `README.md` prerequisites now state that the `pwsh -File` commands need PowerShell 7 (not on a
  stock Windows box) and that `powershell.exe -File` works as a substitute.
- `SKILL.md` says where the `python scripts/…` commands resolve from: the skill folder, not the
  workspace the session runs in.

### Added
- `tests/` at the repo root: guards that every `.ps1` parses and runs under Windows PowerShell 5.1
  and that an installer re-run preserves the user's `.env`.

### Upgrading
Re-copy the skill; the screenshot setup script is the file that changed.

    pwsh -File install\install_skill.ps1

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- `harvest_lookup.py` read `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE` from OS environment variables only, while
  `refresh_catalogs.py` read it from the skill `.env`. Setting it in `.env` — the way
  `.env.example` documents — left refreshes writing catalogs to one directory and lookups
  reading another, so a lookup reported no match against a stale or absent catalog. Both
  now resolve through one shared function.

### Changed
- `harvest_client.py` gains `config(key)` and `find_workspace()`; `refresh_catalogs.py`'s
  private copies of both are gone. `find_workspace()` returns `None` when it cannot resolve
  a workspace — a refresh stops with an error rather than write to a guessed path, and a
  lookup falls back to the live time-entries API.
- Workspace auto-detection no longer includes a `~/Claude/Work/.mcp` fallback. It now checks
  the current directory and the directory the skill is installed under, taking whichever
  already contains `.mcp/` or `Timesheets/`.

### Upgrading
Re-copy the skill:

If you relied on the removed `~/Claude/Work` fallback — that is, you ran the skill from
somewhere else and never set `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE` — set it in `.env` to your workspace's
absolute path. Anything that already sets it, or that runs from the workspace itself, is
unaffected.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- `references/setup.md`, `references/activitywatch.md` and `references/new-client-work.md`.
  `SKILL.md` now points at these instead of carrying the detail inline.
- Classification guidance for interleaved days: how to find the point where the work
  switched clients rather than billing the whole block to whichever client dominates.
- Guidance for two cases where the focused window misreports the work: autonomous agent
  sessions on multi-monitor setups, and long agent CLI sessions that pin one editor tab.
- Billing-convention and note-writing defaults, including translating internal artefact
  names into client-readable descriptions.
- Tests for `harvest_client` and for the Dataverse configuration guard.

### Removed
- `skill/daily-timesheet/docs/` — internal plan and spec documents for a past refactor. They
  were never needed to install or run the skill.

### Changed
- `SKILL.md` restructured and reduced from 400 to 249 lines.
- `harvest_lookup.py` now checks a `TIMESHEET_WORKSPACE`-relative `.mcp` directory first,
  ahead of the existing `./.mcp` and `~/Claude/Work/.mcp` fallbacks.
- `harvest_lookup.py` falls back to a live Harvest time-entries API lookup when a project
  isn't in the local catalogs (its assignment archived, for example), recovering the
  project and task ids from entry history instead. New `--no-live` flag skips this and
  stays cache-only; `--days` controls how far back the fallback looks.
- `afk_blocks.py` reports a `work_end_blip` when the computed work end is a momentary
  flicker long after the last substantive activity, so the final block isn't stretched to it.
- `refresh_catalogs.py`'s Harvest refresh now fetches all pages before removing stale
  catalog files, instead of deleting first — an API failure mid-refresh leaves the
  existing catalog intact rather than half-deleted.
- `refresh_catalogs.py` matches incidents modified in the last 120 days as well as open
  ones, so recently closed tickets still resolve.

### Upgrading
Re-copy the skill; three new files under `references/` will not arrive otherwise.

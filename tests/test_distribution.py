"""Guards on the artifact that actually gets installed.

This repo is a marketplace whose single plugin is the repo root, so what a stranger
installs is not the code these tests import — it is two manifests plus `skills/`. Those
fail in ways no script-level test can see: a manifest that won't parse, a skill whose
declared name disagrees with its directory, a version that drifted from the changelog.
Nothing here reaches into the code that produced the artifact; every assertion is on
something a consumer can read.

The platform's own validator carries most of it. It is not vendored — asserting our idea
of the schema would be asserting our idea of the schema — so the tests that need it skip
when the `claude` CLI isn't on PATH, and the structural assertions below stand on their own
without it.

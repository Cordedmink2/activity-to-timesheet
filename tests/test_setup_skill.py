"""Guards on the `setup` skill — the walkthrough for the parts only a person can do.

Every other skill in this plugin fails loudly: a script exits non-zero and says why. This
one fails *silently*, because what it is walking someone through is a machine the agent
cannot see. A step that is described but never checked reads exactly like a step that
worked, and the cost lands days later as a timesheet with nothing in it.

So the assertions here are about the shape of the walkthrough rather than its prose: that
every step carries a check and a recourse, that the allow-list ask names the strings the
screenshot setup script actually registers, and that the skill can find its sibling
whichever way the plugin was installed. Each one is something that goes stale on an edit
somewhere else in the tree — which is the only kind of prose worth a test.

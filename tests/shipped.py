"""The shipped plugin, as the repo-level suite sees it.

Every module in `tests/` asks the same handful of questions of the artifact this repo
ships: where the repo root is, which directories under `skills/` are skills, what a run of
one of them can read, what a markdown table in `CONTEXT.md` names, which version the
changelog declares. Answered separately in each file those answers drift, and the drift is
silent — `test_distribution.py` and `test_reconcile_skill.py` each grew their own
frontmatter reader, so a correction to one was a correction to one. A helper that stops
finding what it looks for does not raise; it returns nothing, and an assertion over
nothing passes.

Named `shipped` rather than `support` because `skills/daily/tests/` already has a module
called `support` and puts its own directory on `sys.path`. Both suites are collected in a
single pytest run under prepend import mode, so a second `support` would resolve to
whichever of the two was imported first — a collision whose symptom is an unrelated suite
failing on a missing attribute.

Importing this reads no configuration and sets no environment variable. It is paths and
functions only, so nothing about the order the suite imports its modules in can change
what a test sees.

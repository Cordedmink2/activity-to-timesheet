"""The session-start hook re-points the screenshot task after a plugin update (#29).

The `WorkScreenshots` task stores an absolute path to `screenshot_capture.py`, and under a
plugin install that path is inside the *versioned* cache directory — right for the session
that registered it and wrong for every session after the next `/plugin update`. Two things
then happen, and the second is the one the health check misses: if the harness prunes the old
version directory every trigger fails `0x80070002`; if it leaves it in place — which is what
a real `claude plugin update` did on 2026-09-03, 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 side by side — the task
keeps running the superseded capture script indefinitely with `LastTaskResult 0`, which is
exactly the health check `setup` hands the user.

So the hook that already runs at every session start compares the stored path against its
own plugin root and, when they disagree, rewrites that one path and nothing else. These
tests pin the decision (which tasks are touched, which are left alone), the surgery (only
the plugin root inside the first argument changes), and the contract the hook inherits
(exit `0` whatever the machine has). The write itself is one PowerShell command; the last
test drives it against a throwaway task on a Windows machine, where `Set-ScheduledTask`
preserving the triggers can be observed rather than assumed.

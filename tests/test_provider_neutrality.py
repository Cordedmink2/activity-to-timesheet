"""A guard that keeps one provider's vocabulary out of the shipped rules.

The rules used to map a block's activity straight onto the literal task names of one
Harvest account — `Gen - Development/Configuration`, `Gen - Meeting`, and the rest. Any
other user's account names its tasks differently, so those strings were never generic:
they were one workspace's facts shipped as everybody's defaults. The rules now decide a
**work kind** instead, and the user's own `.context.md` maps work kind → the task their
provider actually offers.

Unlike the redacted names in `test_redaction.py`, these strings are not sensitive, so
they are spelled out here. The scan covers the shipped instruction surface of **every**
skill — `SKILL.md`, `references/*.md`, `scripts/*.py` under each of them — because a new
skill is exactly where the drift gets back in: it is written against whichever account
its author happened to be looking at, and the rules that were cleaned up don't govern it.
Test fixtures are deliberately out of scope: the provider adapter's tests have to feed it
the provider's real shapes, and a fake API response is not a rule.

The second test is the positive half. A denylist only says what the rules stopped
saying; it cannot tell whether what they say now is the shared vocabulary. So the work
kinds the rules name are checked against the glossary in `CONTEXT.md`, which is what
makes the glossary load-bearing rather than decorative.

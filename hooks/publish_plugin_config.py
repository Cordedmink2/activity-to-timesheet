"""Publish the declared plugin configuration into the session environment.

The manifest's `userConfig` block is where a user's machine and account facts are
declared, and the harness stores them for them — non-sensitive values in `settings.json`,
sensitive ones in its own credential store. It hands them back as `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>`
environment variables, but only to *hook* processes. The skill's scripts are run by the
model through the shell, in a process that never sees a hook's environment.

`$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is the bridge. On SessionStart the harness passes the path of a shell
fragment it will apply to later commands in the session; anything exported there arrives
at the scripts as an ordinary environment variable. So the values land in the layer
`skill_config` already documents as "the process environment, which is where a harness
injects values" — no new precedence, no second reader, nothing for the scripts to know
about the harness.

**How far the bridge reaches: Claude Code's Bash tool, and nothing else.** The fragment is
POSIX shell and is applied as a preamble to Bash tool calls; the PowerShell tool is given
no equivalent and loads no profile, so a script the model happens to run through
PowerShell sees none of this. That is a documented scope, not a defect here, and it is not
closed by writing a second fragment: `docs/skills/daily/decision-log.md` § "Two ways the
configuration does not arrive" records the two mechanisms that would close it and why
neither was taken. What closes it instead is the skills directing every read of a
configured value through Bash, and `skill_config.note_for_an_unreached_shell()` naming the
shell when one gets through anyway.

The option key *is* the setting key. The harness derives the variable name by upper-casing
the declared key and replacing anything outside `[A-Za-z0-9_]` with `_`; every key this
plugin declares is already an upper-case identifier, so stripping the prefix recovers the
name the scripts ask `setting()` for, exactly. `tests/test_plugin_config.py` pins that,
because a key declared as `harvest.api-key` would round-trip to something else silently.

Nothing here *lists* the options: the set to publish is read back out of the manifest
beside this file, so the manifest stays the single declaration of the surface and the two
cannot drift. Reading it rather than trusting the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_` prefix is
deliberate — see `option_values()`.

**The second job this hook does: re-point the screenshot task after a plugin update.** The
`WorkScreenshots` task stores an absolute path to `screenshot_capture.py`, and under a plugin
install that path is inside the versioned cache directory this file also lives in. It is
right for the session that registered it and for no session after the next update: if the
old directory is pruned every trigger fails `0x80070002`, and if it is left in place — which
is what was observed — the task keeps running the superseded release's capture script with
`LastTaskResult 0`, looking healthy to the very check `setup` hands the user. This hook runs
at every session start from inside the *current* version, so it compares the stored path
against its own plugin root and, when they disagree, rewrites that one path and nothing
else. See `repair_screenshot_task()`; `tests/test_screenshot_task_repair.py` pins it. Issue
#29 has the design and the two alternatives it rejects.

No third-party deps — stdlib only, like every other script in this plugin.
